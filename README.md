## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu; see scripts/setup_deps.sh for other platforms)
./scripts/setup_deps.sh

# 2. Build and test          (~2 min build, ~3 min tests on 4 cores)
make build
make test

# 3. Solve one case          (~0.1 s plane, ~1 s solid)
make benchmark CASE=cantilever_analysis
make benchmark CASE=block_3d_analysis

# 4. Verification studies    (~6 min, exits non-zero if any tolerance is missed)
make verify

# 5. Cross-validation         (needs scikit-fem; CalculiX's ccx if installed)
make cross-validation

# 6. Everything: all benchmarks, the design study, scaling, figures, tables
make all
```

Only Eigen 3.3+ and a C++17 compiler are required to build; OpenMP is used
by the multigrid solver, and by Eigen inside the Jacobi CG solver, when the
compiler has it. Catch2 is used for the tests
and is fetched automatically if the system package is absent. The Python
layer needs `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `pillow`; the cross-validation
additionally needs `scikit-fem` and, for the CalculiX half, `ccx` on the path.
The mesh files the real-geometry decks read are committed; regenerating
them, and the Tet4 / Tet10 study that meshes the engine mount afresh, needs
the `gmsh` Python package.

Every target is a thin wrapper over a script or a binary, so anything can also
be typed by hand:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j
./build/bin/sparlab_solve  --config configs/verification/block_3d_analysis.json --output results/x --export-calculix

```

numerical regression gate. Full detail, including what is *not* covered, in
[`docs/verification.md`](docs/verification.md).

| **MITC4 shells**: a simply supported plate under pressure and compression, the whole Scordelis-Lo roof, the pinched hemisphere, a box beam from an S4R file with two thicknesses; displacements and rotations, frequencies, buckling load factors | an independent MITC4 written in NumPy | `<= 6.20e-09` (the box beam's rotations `2.58e-07`, below its round-off scale `3.8e-07`); frequencies and load factors `<= 1.63e-11` | `1e-7` |
| **Timoshenko beams**: a space frame of rectangles (its weight with floor loads, a lateral load), a tied tube arch with an Euler-Bernoulli tie (a crown load, snow), an Euler-Bernoulli tube Z-frame; displacements and rotations, end resultants, frequencies (consistent and lumped mass), buckling load factors, harmonic monitors | an independent Timoshenko frame written in NumPy / CalculiX `U1` in its Euler-Bernoulli limit (the Z-frame) | `<= 1.27e-10` / `9.14e-08` | `1e-9` / `2e-6` |

scikit-fem implements the same element formulations independently, so its
differences are linear-solver round-off: each lies below the round-off scale
of its system, the condition number of the stiffness matrix times eps (up to
`1.5e-6` for the slender Tet10 beams). CalculiX's `C3D8`, `C3D4` and
`C3D10` are the same elements as the Hex8, Tet4 and Tet10, and the `5e-07` to
`4e-06` displacement differences are within the six significant digits of
its `.frd` result file - as close as that format lets one see. For buckling,
scikit-fem assembles its own geometric stiffness and agrees to `1e-9`;
CalculiX's `*BUCKLE` agrees to `6e-6` on `C3D4` and sits `4e-5` to `8e-5`
high on `C3D8` and `C3D10`, for a reason not identified, which is recorded
rather than explained away. Its plane elements are a layer of solid elements
internally, which matches plane stress only at `nu = 0`: the lug bracket at
its real `nu = 0.33` differs from CalculiX by `1.1e-03`, and is therefore
recorded as a comparison between idealisations rather than judged
([details](docs/verification.md)). The large-deflection states agree with an
independent total Lagrangian solver written on scikit-fem to `1e-14`, and
with CalculiX's `NLGEOM` - its own follower pressure and deformed-position
centrifugal load - to `6e-07` to `4e-06`. The elastoplastic states agree
with an independent J2 solver written on scikit-fem - small strain and
finite kinematics, E-bar included - to `7e-12` or better, and with
CalculiX's `*PLASTIC` to `1.8e-06` to `3.3e-06`; CalculiX's finite-strain
plasticity, a different model, differs by `1.8e-04` and is recorded as
informational. The transient histories - monitors at every step, snapshot
fields, the final displacement, velocity and acceleration - agree with an
independent HHT-alpha integration on scikit-fem's matrices to `2.2e-08` or
better, elastoplastic and large-deflection runs included, and with
CalculiX's `*DYNAMIC` to `6e-07` to `2.1e-06`; CalculiX's plane elements are
left out of the dynamics, their `*DYNAMIC` response contradicting CalculiX's
own `*FREQUENCY`. The harmonic responses agree with a direct complex solve
to `1.0e-10`. The contact states agree with an independent contact solve on
scikit-fem - its own mortar integrals and a different Newton method - to
`8.6e-13` or better in displacement, pressure and traction, every node in the same
status, and with CalculiX's dual mortar contact to `4e-06`, its output
rounding, once its `HARD` contact's penalty is set stiff enough and its
geometry update kept to one increment. The shells agree with an
independent MITC4 written in NumPy - displacements, rotations, frequencies
and buckling load factors - to within the round-off of each system, and
satisfy its equations to a backward error of `3.2e-15`; CalculiX's `S4`,
which expands a shell into solids over its own normals and holds rotations
through rigid knots, is a different discretisation, and its differences
(`3e-06` on a homogeneous state, `3.4e-03` on the roof, `0.89` on the coarse
hemisphere, where it locks) are recorded, not judged: refined, it
converges to SparLab's answer. The beams agree with an independent
Timoshenko frame written in NumPy - displacements, rotations, end
resultants, frequencies with either mass, buckling load factors and the
harmonic response - to `1.3e-10` or better. CalculiX's `U1` beam, whose
shear term stiffens the beam in version 2.21, is compared in its
Euler-Bernoulli limit and agrees to `9.1e-08`, the seven digits it prints;
its `B31`, one brick over the rectangle, differs by 4 to 15 % on the space
frame and is recorded, not judged. Of the 251 comparisons, 232 are judged
and pass, and 19 are informational.

Every OC run but the robust one meets the volume constraint at its returned
design to between `1.1e-11` and `9.6e-11` relative. Without the projection it
holds at every recorded iteration too; with it, the starting design and the
first design after each `beta` step are analysed before an update puts them
back on the target. The robust OC run holds the *dilated* design to a
rescaled target (met to `9.6e-11`); its blueprint follows only through the
ratio of the two volumes, and ends 0.41 % under the volume fraction. MMA
treats the volume as an explicit constraint and meets it between `-2.0e-4`
and `-2.8e-6`, on the feasible side. The optimisation times come from one
4-core machine: the direct solver runs on one core and the multigrid solver
on four.

"Stiffness gain" compares against a *uniform plate of the same mass*, not
against the solid domain. In this 2-D idealisation `K` and `M` both scale
linearly with thickness, so such a plate has compliance `C_solid / nu` and
exactly the full-solid frequencies - the runs verify that frequency invariance
numerically (to `2.5e-12`) rather than assuming it.

The wing rib's gain below 1 is a real result, not a solver failure: diagnostic
runs show the optimiser beats uniform thinning by 4.6 % with full design
freedom, and that the *mandated attachment features* - spar pads and skin
flanges, forced solid and charged against the same volume budget - cost 16 %
between them. Measured on its **interpreted** structure instead of on the
objective, the rib comes out level with the plate rather than 10.6 % short of
it (1.006 after correcting for the 1.3 % mass thresholding adds) - the reported
objective is the pessimistic one, for the reason the design study takes apart.
See [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).

The column's gain below 1 is real too, and it is the plane model talking.
The equal-mass plate is 2.5 mm thick instead of 10 mm; in plane it buckles at
`lambda_1 = 37.4` (a quarter of the solid's 149.65, since `K` scales with the
thickness and `K_G` does not), so in this idealisation it beats the
constrained design on both counts. Out of its plane - which a plane model
cannot see - a 2.5 mm plate 1 m tall buckles at about 130 N by Euler's
formula, and the optimised column's 10 mm members are not safe out of plane
either: the benchmark is an in-plane stability problem, a web braced out of
its plane ([section 12](docs/benchmarks.md#12-a-column-with-a-buckling-constraint)).

### Stress constraint: what it buys

The L-bracket is the canonical stress-constrained case: a square with its
upper-right quadrant removed, clamped at the top of one arm and loaded at the
tip of the other, whose compliance-optimal design fills the re-entrant corner
and concentrates stress there. The same deck run with and without a 9.4 MPa
aggregated von Mises limit (`P = 8`, `q = 0.5`, MMA):

| | Constraint off | Constraint on |
|---|---:|---:|
| Compliance | 0.08528 J | 0.08956 J (+5.0 %) |
| Relaxed stress peak of the design / limit | 1.66 | **0.994** (feasible) |
| Re-solved thresholded structure: peak von Mises / limit | **1.078** | **0.810** |

A 25 % lower peak stress in the re-solved structure for 5.0 % more
compliance, with the corner visibly rounded
([figure](docs/figures/l_bracket_stress_stress_comparison.png)). The
constraint bounds the *relaxed* stress of the density model; the re-solve of
the thresholded structure is the number that says whether the part meets the
limit, and both are reported.

### Heaviside projection: what it buys

![The MBB beam with and without the Heaviside projection](docs/figures/mbb_beam_projection.png)

The MBB beam and the solid bracket, each run with and without the
projection:

| | MBB beam | MBB beam, projected | Solid bracket | Solid bracket, projected |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Grey level | 0.279 | **0.021** | 0.336 | **0.013** |
| Thresholded structure / optimised compliance | 0.851 | **0.995** | 0.609 | **0.983** |
| Thresholded structure [J] | 188.60 | 188.63 | 0.1763 | 0.1787 |
| Thresholded volume fraction | 0.510 | 0.501 | 0.312 | 0.302 |

Without a projection the reported compliance describes a grey field: the
thresholded part is 15 % (MBB) and 39 % (bracket) stiffer than the
optimiser said. With it, the reported compliance and the part agree to
0.5 % and 1.7 %. The part itself changes little, so what the projection
buys is a number that means what it says. At a sharp projection the design
change never settles, so the projected decks stop on the compliance
instead: a spread below 0.1 % over 10 iterations
([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

### Buckling constraint: what it buys

![The column with and without the buckling constraint](docs/figures/column_buckling_comparison.png)

A 0.5 m x 1 m aluminium plate, 10 mm thick, clamped at its base and loaded
by 100 kN of axial compression on a pad at the top, with a quarter of its
material. The same deck three ways:

| | Compliance only | `lambda >= 6`, plain projection | `lambda >= 6`, robust projection |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Compliance | 112.182 J | 159.209 J | 186.636 J |
| Lowest load factor, SIMP model | - | 6.0005 | 6.0020 (eroded design) |
| Lowest load factor, **exported part** | **2.86** | **3.65** | **5.81** |

The compliance optimum is a single strut that buckles at 2.86 times its
load. With the constraint, the SIMP model the optimiser sees meets
`lambda >= 6` - but with a plain projection its bracing is grey, and the
exported part, thresholded and re-analysed as solid aluminium, buckles at
3.65. Acting on the eroded design, the robust formulation denies the
optimiser members that erosion removes, and the part reaches 5.81, 3 %
short of the requirement. The part's value is the one to judge; both are
reported ([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

### Robust formulation and overhang filter: what they buy

| | MBB beam, plain projection | MBB beam, robust |
|---|---:|---:|
| Compliance as drawn | 189.654 J | 195.485 J |
| Compliance if the part comes out thinner (eroded, `eta = 0.6`) | 231.398 J (**+22.0 %**) | 204.051 J (**+4.4 %**) |
| Smallest member / narrowest gap | 3 / 5 cells | 4 / 6 cells |

The robust design pays 3 % as drawn and loses a fifth as much stiffness to
the erosion, because none of its members is thin enough to vanish
([figure](docs/figures/mbb_beam_robust_comparison.png)).

![The MBB beam built without and with the overhang filter](docs/figures/mbb_beam_overhang_comparison.png)

| | Unsupported solid elements | Compliance |
|---|---:|---:|
| MBB beam, no filter (built +y) | 132 of 5 420 (2.4 %) | 186.441 J |
| MBB beam, overhang filter, built +y / -y | **0** / **0** | 193.255 J (+3.7 %) / 206.731 J (+10.9 %) |
| Solid bracket, no filter (built +y) | 78 of 1 234 (6.3 %) | 0.180861 J |
| Solid bracket, overhang filter | **0** | 0.188922 J (+4.5 %) |

With the filter no solid element lacks support directly or diagonally below
it - a 45-degree overhang limit - so the designs are printable under that
rule, and only under that rule ([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

### Quadratic tetrahedra: what they buy

![Tet4 against Tet10 on the engine mount](docs/figures/tet10_part_study.png)

The engine mount meshed from CAD by Gmsh at 8 to 1.5 mm, solved on linear
tetrahedra, on the same meshes elevated to Tet10, and on curved Tet10 cells:

| Mesh | DOFs | Compliance, vertical load | vs finest Tet10 |
|------|-----:|--------------------------:|----------------:|
| Tet4, 4 mm (the benchmark's mesh) | 25 920 | 0.332694 J | **-18.9 %** |
| Tet4, 1.5 mm | 357 087 | 0.391839 J | -4.4 % |
| Tet10 curved, 6 mm | 61 812 | 0.400594 J | -2.3 % |
| Tet10 curved, 3 mm | 388 488 | 0.410003 J | reference |

A part meshed with linear tetrahedra reads a fifth too stiff on the mesh the
benchmark uses, and still 4.4 % at 14 times the unknowns; the curved Tet10 is
closer at 6 mm than the Tet4 at 1.5 mm with 5.8 times fewer unknowns. The
finest run is itself a lower bound, so no extrapolated exact value is
claimed ([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

### Real geometry

Two parts drawn and meshed in Gmsh by `python/scripts/make_meshes.py`, read
through the mesh-file readers, with their physical groups as the supports,
the loads and the solid rings around the holes:

| | Lug bracket | Engine mount |
|---|---:|---:|
| Mesh file | Gmsh MSH 4.1 | Abaqus / CalculiX `.inp` |
| Elements, DOFs | 20 336 Tri3, 20 834 | 39 936 Tet4, 25 920 |
| Solver chosen by `auto` | Cholesky | multigrid CG |
| Iterations, stop | 211, objective stall at `beta` 32 | 265, objective stall at `beta` 16 |
| Thresholded / optimised compliance | 0.996 | 0.955 |
| Against the baseline | **1.147** times as stiff as the equal-mass plate | 1.95 times the full part's compliance at 25 % of its mass |
| `f1`, full part to optimised | 2202 to **2902 Hz** | 1278 to **1795 Hz** |
| Optimisation time | 37.7 s | 278.5 s |

The engine mount's rings take almost half of its 25 % material budget. Its
first run, started from a uniform 0.25, stopped before the first update:
the move limit could not bring the part down to its budget in one step,
and the optimiser said so instead of returning an infeasible design. The
deck now starts at 0.15 ([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

### Three dimensions

![Solid bracket at 356 475 DOFs before and after optimisation](docs/figures/bracket_3d_large_topology.png)

A 0.24 x 0.12 x 0.06 m aluminium block, clamped on one face and loaded at the
far end in two load cases (3 kN down, 1.2 kN sideways), with 30 % of its
volume to place:

| | `bracket_3d` | `bracket_3d_large` |
|---|---:|---:|
| Mesh | 4 096 Hex8, 15 147 DOFs | 110 592 Hex8, **356 475 DOFs** |
| Linear solver | sparse Cholesky | **multigrid CG**, 23.5 iterations per solve |
| Projection | none | Heaviside, `beta` 1 to 16 |
| Iterations, optimisation time | 157, 450 s | 171, 1 340 s |
| Grey level | 0.34 | **0.00086** |
| Thresholded structure / optimised compliance | 0.61 | **0.9997** |
| Thresholded structure / full solid block, compliance | 2.35 | 2.18 |
| `f1`, thresholded structure vs solid block | +9.8 % at 31 % of the mass | **+25.7 %** at 30 % of the mass |

The coarse run shows why a solid density design needs a projection: its
grey level is 0.34, and the structure it thresholds to is 39 % stiffer than
the compliance the optimiser reported. The fine run shows what the
multigrid solver makes possible. It optimises 23.5 times the unknowns with
the projection on, in three times the time, and the part it exports is the
design it optimised. Both parts are exported as closed STL surfaces, and
the fine one is also 2-manifold. The compliance ratios are against the full
solid on each run's own mesh ([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

### Modal: what optimisation does to the spectrum

| Case | Structure | Mass [kg] | `f1` [Hz] | `f2` [Hz] |
|------|-----------|----------:|----------:|----------:|
| Cantilever | full solid / equal-mass plate | 0.899 / 0.360 | 872.1 | 3173.0 |
| Cantilever | optimised topology | 0.360 | **1016.4** | 1685.7 |
| Bracket | full solid / equal-mass plate | 1.349 / 0.472 | 1437.2 | 4252.3 |

Compliance optimisation raises the fundamental frequency of the cantilever
(+16 %) and the bracket (+41 %) at equal mass, and **lowers** it sharply for the
wing rib (-74 %). In every plane case the *higher* modes fall, because a
truss has local member modes a continuous plate does not; the solid designs
keep `f2` and `f3` above the solid block's but lose `f4`. A compliance objective sees only
the static load path; a design with a vibration requirement needs that
requirement in the optimisation, which this single-constraint optimiser cannot
carry. Discussion in [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md) and
[`docs/aerospace_study.md`](docs/aerospace_study.md).

### Design study: 41 runs, 7 arms

The bracket is swept over volume fraction, load-case weighting, mesh resolution
(twice), SIMP penalty, filter radius and Young's modulus. All 41 points
converge on the stated criteria and meet the volume constraint. The findings
that changed how the rest of this project is set up:

| Finding | Measurement |
|---------|-------------|
| **The reported objective ranks the numerical settings backwards** | Reported stiffness gain spans **0.72-1.22** and crosses parity with a uniform plate eight times; the *interpreted* structures of the 38 sound points span **1.01-1.27** and never cross it. The three best points on the reported objective are the three worst structures in the study |
| A mandated feature can dominate the answer | The passive attachment collars are 3.9 % of the domain but **25.8 %** of the volume budget at `nu` = 0.15, which is most of why the payoff falls from 26.6 % to 1.0 % as the budget shrinks |
| Quote the filter radius in metres, never in cells | Radius fixed in metres, five meshes agree to **1.2 %**; radius fixed at 1.5 cells, the same meshes spread **28 %** and the topology chases the mesh |
| Check the filter is resolved and the penalty high enough | Three points produced designs that fall apart when thresholded - two from an identity filter (average support **1.000** element, up to **494** disconnected groups) and one from `p` = 1.5, whose interpretation is **6.75x** softer than the field it came from |
| A minimum length scale is not free | **36.9 %** more reported compliance between a 3.75 mm and a 15 mm filter radius |
| The local optimum costs something real | Two runs of the same problem reached designs **1.3 %** apart on the same objective |
| One load case was doing nothing | `up_reversal` is exactly `-0.5` times `down_limit`, so its compliance is `0.25 C_down` to ten digits and the compliance objective cannot see it |
| The runs are reproducible to the last bit | The study was run on three separately compiled binaries, the last one after the cached-pattern assembly and the new stall criterion went in; all 41 points reproduced with a relative difference of **exactly zero** every time |

### Runtime scaling

One linear solve from scratch, the factorisation plus a back-substitution or
the multigrid setup plus CG to a relative residual of `1e-10`
(`make scaling`):

| | Q4 plate | Hex8 block | Tet4 block |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Largest mesh both solvers ran | 194 922 DOFs | 47 775 DOFs | 15 147 DOFs |
| Sparse Cholesky | 3.98 s | 43.5 s | 1.90 s |
| Multigrid CG | 0.571 s | 0.637 s | 0.325 s |
| **Cholesky / multigrid** | **7.0** | **68** | **5.9** |
| Largest multigrid run | 1 003 002 DOFs in 3.06 s | 830 115 DOFs in 13.0 s | 109 395 DOFs in 1.56 s |
| CG iterations over the range | 14 to 17 | 14 to 17 | 16 to 21 |
| Growth slope of the time, Cholesky / multigrid | 1.56 / 1.03 | 2.35 / 0.95 | 2.32 / 0.78 |

With the direct solver one optimiser iteration costs essentially one
factorisation. That follows from two design decisions: compliance is
self-adjoint, so no adjoint solve is needed (the stress constraint adds one
back-substitution per load case, not a second factorisation), and one
factorisation of `K_ff` is shared across every load case. In 2-D that is
cheap. In 3-D the factorisation grows like `n^2.35`, which is why solid
problems above 10 000 unknowns go to multigrid CG by default. Its iteration
count barely moves with the mesh, and inside an optimisation it reuses its
aggregates and starts every solve from the previous design's answer
([details](docs/benchmarks.md)).

## Formulation

The full derivation is in [`docs/formulation.md`](docs/formulation.md); the
essentials:

**Elements.** Bilinear Q4 shape functions on `(xi, eta) in [-1,1]^2`,

```
  N_1 = 1/4 (1-xi)(1-eta)   N_2 = 1/4 (1+xi)(1-eta)
  N_3 = 1/4 (1+xi)(1+eta)   N_4 = 1/4 (1-xi)(1+eta)
```

and their trilinear Hex8 counterparts `N_a = 1/8 (1 + xi_a xi)(1 + eta_a eta)(1 + zeta_a zeta)`;
isoparametric mapping `x = sum_a N_a x_a`, Jacobian `J_ij = dx_i/dxi_j`, and

```
  K_e = sum_g w_g t detJ B^T D B        (2 x 2 Gauss, exact for the Q4; 2 x 2 x 2 for the Hex8)
  M_e = sum_g w_g rho t detJ N^T N      (3 x 3 Gauss; 3 x 3 x 3)
  f_e = sum_g w_g t |x_s (x x_t)| N^T t_bar   (2-point per direction, along an edge or over a face)
```

with `D` the plane-stress, plane-strain or full 3-D isotropic matrix and `B`
`3 x 8` or `6 x 24`. The Tet10 uses `N_i = L_i (2 L_i - 1)` at the corners
and `4 L_a L_b` on the edges in barycentric coordinates, isoparametric (so
its edges may curve with the CAD surface), a 4-point stiffness rule, and
Hinton-Rock-Zienkiewicz lumping where a row-sum lump would be indefinite.

**Linear buckling.** For a load case with displacement `u`,

```
  (K_ff + lambda K_G,ff(u)) phi = 0 ,     phi^T K_G phi = int sigma_ij(u) phi_k,i phi_k,j
```

solved for the smallest positive `lambda` by subspace iteration on
`K^-1 (-K_G)`, switching to the spectral transformation
`(K + sigma K_G)^-1 K` with `sigma` placed by the inertia of an `LDL^T`
factorisation when reversed-load modes crowd the spectrum.

**Large deflection.** Total Lagrangian: with `F = I + grad u` and
`E = (F^T F - I) / 2`,

```
  R(u, lambda) = int B_NL(u)^T S(E) dV0 - f_ext(u, lambda) = 0 ,
  K_T = int (B_NL^T D_T B_NL + G^T S G) dV0 - d f_ext / d u
```

with `S = D (E - E_theta I) / theta` (Saint Venant-Kirchhoff, the thermal
stretch `theta = 1 + alpha dT` split off multiplicatively) or
`S = mu (I - C^-1) + lambda ln J C^-1` (neo-Hookean), follower pressures and
the deformed-position centrifugal load in `d f_ext / d u`, and Newton with an
energy line search under load control or Crisfield's arc length.

**Contact.** Small sliding on the reference geometry. At slave node j the
weighted gap is

```
  g_j = g0_j + D_j nu_j . u_j - sum_l M_jl nu_j . u_l ,    D_j = int N_j dA ,   M_jl = int psi_j N_l^m dA
```

with the dual basis `int psi_j N_k dA = delta_jk D_j` of each slave face
(dual mortar), or the nodal gap to a rigid obstacle; `g_j >= 0`, `p_j >= 0`,
`p_j g_j = 0` and Coulomb's law on the slip of each step are solved by a
semismooth Newton method on the condensed pressure
`p_j = nu_F . R_F / (D_j |nu_F|^2)`, whose step is a symmetric problem while
no node slips.

**Shells (MITC4).** A degenerated continuum over nodal directors `V_k`,

```
  X = sum_k N_k (x_k + zeta t/2 V_k),     u = sum_k N_k (u_k + zeta t/2 theta_k x V_k)
```

with six DOFs per node (translations and rotations about the global axes),
plane stress in the local frame, and `k G` (`k = 5/6`) on transverse shear
strains interpolated from the edge midpoints (Dvorkin and Bathe), which
removes shear locking; the rotation about the director is tied to the
in-plane rotation of the mid-surface by the penalty
`1/2 alpha G t int (n . theta - omega)^2 dA`, `alpha = 1e-3`.

**Beams (Timoshenko).** Two nodes with six DOFs each. In the element's axes
each bending plane uses Reddy's interdependent interpolation - the cubic
deflection and quadratic rotation that solve the unloaded Timoshenko
equations - and stretching and Saint-Venant torsion are linear:

```
  Phi = 12 E I / (k G A L^2)                     (0 without shear deformation: Euler-Bernoulli)
  M_e = int rho N^T diag(A, A, A, I_p, I_y, I_z) N dx
  K_G,e = N int [u'^2 + v'^2 + w'^2 + (I_p/A) theta_x'^2 + (I_y/A) theta_y'^2 + (I_z/A) theta_z'^2] dx
```

so the stiffness is the exact one (Przemieniecki's closed form), nodal
values are exact under end and uniform loads on any mesh, there is no shear
locking, and the geometric stiffness is that of the element's axial force
`N = E A (u_1 - u_0) / L`.

**Boundary conditions by partitioning, not penalty.** The reduced system is
`K_ff u_f = f_f - K_fp u_p` and the reactions come from the full residual
`r = K u - f`. This keeps `K_ff` symmetric positive definite, gives exact
reactions with no second assembly, and leaves the eigenvalue spectrum
undistorted.

**SIMP.** The modified law, so a design variable may reach exactly 0 or 1 while
`K` stays invertible:

```
  E(rho)/E_0     = eps + (1 - eps) rho^p ,        eps = E_min/E_0 = 1e-9
  d(E/E_0)/drho  = p (1 - eps) rho^(p-1)
```

Mass is interpolated separately, `m(rho) = eps_m + (1-eps_m) rho^p`, matching
the stiffness exponent so `E/m` stays bounded in void regions and no spurious
low-frequency mode appears.

**Filtering.** `rho_tilde = Hhat x` with row-normalised linear-hat weights
`H_ei = max(0, r_min - |x_e - x_i|)`. Because the map is linear the chain rule is
exact, which is what makes the finite-difference verification meaningful.

**Sensitivities.** Compliance is self-adjoint, so no adjoint solve is needed:

```
  dc/drho_e = -sum_l w_l  d(E(rho_e)/E_0)/drho_e  u_{l,e}^T K_e^0 u_{l,e}  <= 0
  grad_x c  = Hhat^T grad_rho c ,      grad_x g = Hhat^T v
```

**Optimality criteria.** The separable KKT condition
`B_e = (-dc/dx_e)/(lambda dg/dx_e) = 1` gives

```
  x_e^{k+1} = clip( x_e^k B_e^eta , max(x_lo, x_e^k - m) , min(x_hi, x_e^k + m) )
```

with `eta = 1/2`, move limit `m = 0.2`, and `lambda` found by geometric bisection
on the monotone volume map.

**Method of moving asymptotes.** For more than one constraint, each function
is replaced at `x^k` by Svanberg's separable convex approximation
`r_i + sum_j [ p_ij/(U_j - x_j) + q_ij/(x_j - L_j) ]` between moving asymptotes
`L_j < x_j^k < U_j`, and the subproblem is solved by a primal-dual
interior-point method. Convergence requires feasibility
(`max_i g_i <= 1e-4`), and the iterate that was judged is the design returned.

**Stress constraint.** One aggregated constraint per load case,

```
  sigma_e = rho_e^q sigma_vm(D_0 B_e u_e)                  (qp relaxation, q = 0.5)
  g_l     = c_l ( sum_e sigma_e^P )^(1/P) / sigma_lim - 1 <= 0   (P = 8)
```

with the scale `c_l` re-fitted every iteration so the p-norm tracks the true
maximum, and the gradient from one adjoint solve per load case,
`K lambda = d sigma_PN / d u`, on the cached factorisation - verified against
central differences in 2-D and 3-D.

**Buckling constraint.** `KS_P(lambda_req / lambda_i) - 1 <= 0` over the
lowest positive load factors, with the stress in `K_G` interpolated as
`rho^p` without the `E_min` floor (against pseudo modes in void) and each
`d lambda_i / d rho` from one adjoint solve that carries the stress's
dependence on the design.

**Robust formulation and overhang filter.** The filtered field projected at
`eta + delta`, `eta` and `eta - delta`: the objective and constraints on the
eroded design, the volume on the dilated one, the blueprint exported. The
overhang filter `xi_e = smin(rho_tilde_e, smax_{s below e} xi_s)`, layer by
layer from the plate, sits between the density filter and the projection,
with its gradient from an adjoint recursion from the top layer down.

See [`docs/topology_optimization.md`](docs/topology_optimization.md) for the
filters, the projection and its robust form, the overhang filter,
continuation, convergence criteria, MMA, the stress and buckling constraints
and the diagnostics.

## Conventions

Strict SI everywhere: metres, newtons, pascals, kilograms, hertz, joules. No
unit-conversion helpers and no implicit scaling, so a value in a result file is
already in the unit its column header states.

Right-handed axes, with a plane model in the x-y plane. Structured node
numbering `node(i,j,k) = k(nx+1)(ny+1) + j(nx+1) + i` and element numbering
`elem(i,j,k) = k·nx·ny + j·nx + i`, x fastest. Q4 nodes counter-clockwise
from the lower-left corner; Hex8 nodes in the VTK order (bottom face, then
top); Tet10 corners then the edge nodes of `(0 1) (1 2) (2 0) (0 3) (1 3)
(2 3)`, as VTK and C3D10. A buckling load factor multiplies its load case;
modes are `phi^T K phi = 1`. A build direction `+y` grows the part along
`+y` from a plate at low `y`. `dim` translational DOFs per node, `dof(n,c) = dim·n + c`. Forces and
displacements positive along `+x`/`+y`/`+z`; tensile stress positive;
tractions given as a global stress vector, not a normal pressure. Voigt

No cycles, no upward dependencies, and one dimension-generic core: the mesh
carries its dimension at run time, the element kernels are written for their
own dimension, and everything above them is written against `dim` - so the
plane path is byte-for-byte what it was before the solid path existed. Each
component's responsibilities, the design decisions behind them, and what it
takes to add a new element type, a new material model, another mesh format,
a linear solver, a new constraint or another external code are in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Input decks

A run is fully determined by one JSON file. Comments and trailing commas are
accepted; syntax errors report their line and column; **unknown keys are
reported**, and `--strict-config` makes them an error - a misspelled key that
silently takes its default is one of the easiest ways to publish a wrong number.

          "region": { "box": { "xmin": 0.40, "ymin": 0.0975, "ymax": 0.1025 } } }
      ] }
  ],

A solid deck differs only where the dimension shows: `"type": "structured_hex"`
(or `structured_tet`) with `nz` and `lz`, `"fix": ["x", "y", "z"]`,
three-component forces and tractions, `zmin`/`zmax` boxes, cylinders about any
axis and spheres as regions, no thickness. Regions are geometric - box,
circle / cylinder, annulus / tube, sphere, nearest node, explicit ids, unions
and complements - so the same deck applies unchanged at any mesh resolution.

A part drawn in a CAD tool comes in through a mesh file, and its physical
groups become regions:

```json
"mesh":  { "type": "file", "path": "../meshes/engine_mount_3d.inp", "scale": 0.001 },
"boundary_conditions": [ { "fix": ["x", "y", "z"], "region": { "group": "bolt_holes" } } ],
"solver": { "linear": { "type": "auto" } },
"topology": { "projection": { "enabled": true, "beta_max": 16 } }
```

Every field, including the mesh-file, solver, multigrid, projection, MMA and
stress-constraint blocks, is documented in
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

Shipped decks: [`configs/benchmarks/`](configs/benchmarks/) (the four plane
compliance cases and the MBB beam's projected, robust and overhang-filtered
variants, the stress-constrained L-bracket, the buckling-constrained column,
the solid bracket with its projected, overhang-filtered and 356 475-DOF
variants, and the Gmsh lug bracket and engine mount),
[`configs/meshes/`](configs/meshes/) (the lug bracket, and the engine mount
in linear and in curved quadratic tetrahedra, with how they were generated),
[`configs/studies/`](configs/studies/) (the design-study baseline),
[`configs/verification/`](configs/verification/) (the static, modal,
buckling, load, large-deflection, elastoplastic, transient,
frequency-response and contact decks the cross-validation uses, on all five
element types).

A transient or harmonic analysis is one more block:

```json
"transient": { "enabled": true, "time_step": 1e-4, "end_time": 0.03, "alpha": -0.05,
               "damping": { "mass": 20.0, "stiffness": 1e-5 },
               "amplitude": { "type": "table", "times": [0, 0.004], "values": [0, 1] },
               "snapshot_every": 30,
               "monitors": [ { "name": "tip_uy", "component": "y",
                               "region": { "box": { "xmin": 1.0 } } } ] },
"frequency_response": { "enabled": true,
               "frequencies": { "start": 10, "end": 3000, "count": 120, "spacing": "log" },
               "damping": { "structural": 0.02 } }
```

and contact one more, beside a small-strain non-linear analysis:

```json
"nonlinear": { "enabled": true, "kinematics": "small_strain", "steps": 4 },
"contact": { "enabled": true, "pairs": [
  { "name": "indenter", "slave": { "group": "top" }, "friction": 0.3,
    "obstacle": { "type": "sphere", "center": [0, 0.53, 0], "radius": 0.5,
                  "motion": [0, -2e-4, 0] } },
  { "name": "interface", "slave": { "group": "upper_bottom" },
    "master": { "group": "lower_top" } } ] }
```

## Engineering integrity

Things this project deliberately does, because the opposite is easy and wrong:

* **a density field is never presented as geometry without saying how it was
  converted.** Every topology summary records the threshold, the elements
  retained, the number of disconnected groups and the material discarded as
  islands. Every run then re-solves that *extracted* structure with real
  material and reports its own compliance, mass and peak stress, because the
  objective the optimiser minimised is not the compliance of the part a
  threshold would produce - on the bracket the extracted structure comes out
  9-29 % stiffer. With the Heaviside projection the two agree to within 2 %,
  and 4.5 % on the engine mount. The modal analysis of an "optimised
  structure" runs on the same sub-mesh;
* **no manufacturability is claimed beyond what is modelled.** The overhang
  filter models one additive-manufacturing rule and the robust formulation
  one uniform manufacturing error; "0 unsupported elements" means printable
  under that rule, nothing more. No draw direction, tool access, support
  removal, residual stress or fillet is modelled, and the exported STL is
  the voxel boundary of the thresholded cells - closed and outward, checked
  and reported as such, but a staircase, not a part;
* **a buckling constraint is judged on the part.** The constraint holds the
  load factors of the SIMP model; every run with a `buckling` section
  re-analyses the exported part and reports its load factor beside them - on
  the column 3.65 and 5.81 against a SIMP 6.00, printed as such;
* **a stress constraint is not a stress substantiation.** It bounds the
  relaxed, aggregated stress of the density model. Every constrained run
  therefore re-solves its thresholded structure with full material and
  reports that peak against the limit alongside the relaxed one - on the
  L-bracket 0.81 and 0.99 of the limit respectively - and the unconstrained
  run of the same deck sits beside them as the reference;
* **agreement with other codes is measured, not asserted.** The
  cross-validation reports every difference with its tolerance, and says
  where a difference is the reference's own output precision rather than a
  disagreement;
* **no comparison value is invented.** The MBB compliance is reported as
  computed, with the density-, sensitivity- and no-filter variants side by side,
  and without claiming agreement with a literature number that was not
  re-derived under identical settings;
* **failures are reported, not hidden.** Singular matrices, non-positive
  Cholesky pivots, residuals above tolerance, non-convergence, an infeasible
  stress-constrained design, a non-manifold exported surface, disconnected
  topologies and unknown configuration keys all produce a specific, actionable
  message - and the optimiser records *which* convergence criterion fired,
  the final value of every indicator, and under MMA returns the iterate it
  actually judged rather than an unevaluated update;
* **every tolerance is recorded** in the run summary;
* **runs are deterministic.** The only randomness is a seeded filler in the
  subspace-iteration starting basis and the node-perturbation generator, both
  with explicit default seeds. The threaded solvers give the same bits on any
  number of threads, and the aerospace study reproduced all 41 points exactly
  on three separately compiled binaries.

## Assumptions and limitations

The short version: plane, solid, shell and beam models, one kind per model;
the shell (four-node MITC4) linear only - statics, frequencies, the harmonic
response and linear buckling, no triangles or quadratic shells, no composite
layups, locking on coarse distorted or bending-dominated curved meshes; the
beam (two-node Timoshenko) linear too, with Saint-Venant torsion, no
lateral-torsional buckling, no end releases or offsets; static
analysis linear, or non-linear in
`sparlab_solve` - large deflection, and rate-independent J2 plasticity at
small strain, with large rotation (no finite-strain plasticity, creep or
damage) - with no branch switching at a bifurcation of a perfect structure
and no sequences of different loads within a case; contact in the non-linear
statics only, for small displacements and small sliding on linear elements,
against analytic rigid obstacles or declared mortar pairs with constant
Coulomb friction, a body held by its contact alone touching its support at
the start; dynamics by implicit
direct integration with a constant step and one amplitude per case (no
explicit integration, modal superposition, response spectra or random
vibration) and a linear harmonic response with Rayleigh and structural
damping, while modal, linear (bifurcation) buckling and the optimisation stay
linear and elastic; linear
thermoelasticity with a given or steadily conducted temperature (the
finite-strain split in the non-linear analysis), self-weight,
body forces and steady rotation (not yet in the topology optimiser), linear
elements plus the quadratic tetrahedron (no Q8, Tri6 or Hex20) and one
cell type per mesh, attachment features are *representations* and not joint
models, load cases are illustrative and not flight loads, the objective is
weighted compliance and not a load envelope, the constraints are the volume,
an aggregated relaxed stress and an aggregated SIMP buckling load (no
frequency or displacement constraints), the robust formulation's length
scale is measured rather than stated, the overhang rule needs a structured
grid, one machine and no distributed memory, cross-validation of
displacements on thirty-eight problems, of buckling load factors on three,
of large-deflection states on four, of elastoplastic states on ten, of
transient histories on five, of harmonic responses on two, of contact
states on six, of shell displacements, frequencies and buckling load
factors on four (against an independent MITC4; CalculiX's shell is a
different discretisation) and of beam displacements, end resultants,
frequencies, buckling load factors and harmonic responses on three (against
an independent Timoshenko frame and, on one, CalculiX's `U1`; its `B31` is a
different model), no comparison against experiment.

The long version, with what it would take to lift each item, is in
[`docs/limitations.md`](docs/limitations.md). It is worth reading before
treating any number here as a design answer.

## Continuous integration

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs three jobs:

* **build and test** on GCC and Clang, in Release and Debug, with
  `-DSPARLAB_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON`. The Debug build enables Eigen's own
  assertions, which is the configuration most likely to catch an indexing
  mistake;
* **verification** runs all the studies, plane, solid, shell and beam, and fails
  the build if any documented tolerance is missed, uploading the summary
  either way;
* **benchmark** runs the static, modal and buckling analyses on all five
  element types and both Gmsh parts, the decks of the pressure, volume and
  thermal loads, the four large-deflection decks, the ten elastoplastic
  decks, the seven transient and frequency-response decks, the six
  contact decks, the four shell decks and the three beam decks, the half
  of the cross-validation that needs no CalculiX on all fifty-one problems -
  displacements with SparLab's loads and with the loads integrated by
  scikit-fem, the buckling load factors of the three columns, the final
  states of the dead-load large-deflection cases against scikit-fem's own
  total Lagrangian solver, the elastoplastic states, small strain and
  finite, against its own J2 solver, and the transient histories and
  harmonic responses against an HHT-alpha integration in the acceleration
  form and a direct complex solve on scikit-fem's matrices, the contact
  states against an independent contact solve, and the shells and beams
  against an independent MITC4 and Timoshenko frame in NumPy -
  (which fails the build on a disagreement), reduced topology optimisations covering OC, MMA with the
  stress constraint, the Hex8 path, the projection with and without, the
  multigrid solver, the two parts read from mesh files, the buckling
  constraint, the robust formulation and the overhang filter with their
  comparison runs, small direct / multigrid / Jacobi scaling runs, and
  regenerates the figures and tables - so a break in the whole pipeline, not
  just the library, is caught.
