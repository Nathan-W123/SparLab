/// \brief Declarative JSON input deck: schema, parsing and model construction.
///
/// An input deck fully determines a run. The schema is documented in
/// docs/configuration.md; the section names below mirror it one to one:
/// \code
/// {
///   "name": "cantilever_beam",
///   "mesh":     { "type": "structured_quad", "nx":.., "ny":.., "lx":.., "ly":.. },
///               // or { "type": "structured_hex", "nx","ny","nz", "lx","ly","lz" }
///               // or "structured_tri" / "structured_tet" with the same keys
///               // or { "type": "file", "path": "part.msh", "scale": 0.001 }
///               // "order": 2 turns tetrahedra into 10-node Tet10 cells
///   "material": { "youngs_modulus":.., "poisson_ratio":.., "density":.. },
///   "model":    { "thickness":.., "stress_state": "plane_stress" },
///   "boundary_conditions": [ { "fix": ["x","y"], "region": {..} } ],
///   "load_cases":          [ { "name":.., "weight":.., "point_loads": [..] } ],
///   "solver":   { "linear": {..}, "equilibrium_tolerance":.. },
///   "modal":    { "enabled": true, "num_modes":.. },
///   "buckling": { "enabled": true, "num_modes":.., "load_cases": [..] },
///   "topology": { "enabled": true, "volume_fraction":.., "filter": {..} },
///   "output":   { "vtk": true, "csv": true }
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// The mesh fixes the spatial dimension of the whole deck: a solid mesh
/// (`structured_hex`, `structured_tet`, or a file of tetrahedra / hexahedra)
/// takes three-entry vectors, may fix `z`, and uses the three-dimensional
/// constitutive law; a plane mesh (`structured_quad`, `structured_tri`, or a
/// file of triangles / quadrilaterals) takes two-entry vectors and a plane
/// stress state. Mixing the two is an error rather than a silently truncated
/// component. A mesh file is therefore read while the deck is parsed; its
/// `path` is relative to the deck's own directory, and its physical groups
/// (Gmsh) or *NSET / *ELSET cards (Abaqus) become regions through
/// `{"group": "<name>"}`.
///
/// Every numeric field is in SI units. Unknown keys are reported (not ignored),
/// because a misspelled key that silently takes its default is a direct route
/// to a wrong published number.
