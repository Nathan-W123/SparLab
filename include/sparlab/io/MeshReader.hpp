/// \file MeshReader.hpp
/// \brief Import of unstructured meshes from Gmsh (.msh) and Abaqus / CalculiX
///        (.inp) files.
///
/// Real geometry - a bracket with curved outlines, a fitting with bolt holes -
/// comes from a mesh generator, not from the structured box generators. These
/// readers turn such a file into a `Mesh` plus its named sets, and check it
/// the way a file from someone else's tool needs checking:
///
///   * **element types.** The cells of the highest dimension present become
///     the mesh: linear triangles or quadrilaterals for a plane model, linear
///     tetrahedra or hexahedra for a solid. Lower-dimensional elements (the
///     boundary lines and facets a mesher writes for its physical groups) are
///     used only to build named node sets. A mix of cell types (triangles and
///     quadrilaterals, a hex-dominant mesh with prisms), second-order cells and
///     prisms / pyramids are refused with a message that says how to re-export;
///   * **orientation.** Inverted simplices and mirrored quads / hexes are
///     re-ordered and counted; a cell that is folded rather than mirrored is an
///     error naming the element;
///   * **units.** Coordinates are multiplied by `scale` (0.001 for a CAD file in
///     millimetres), and a domain larger than 20 m or smaller than 0.1 mm draws
///     a warning that names the likely fix;
///   * **plane meshes.** A 2-D mesh must lie in the z = 0 plane;
///   * **unused and duplicate nodes.** Nodes no cell references (geometry
///     points, dropped entities) are removed and counted. Coincident nodes,
///     which leave the cells on either side unconnected, are counted and
///     optionally merged.
///
/// Named sets. A Gmsh physical group becomes a node set (every node of every
/// element in the group, of any dimension) and, when it holds cells of the
/// mesh dimension, an element set. An unnamed physical group is called
/// `point:<tag>`, `curve:<tag>`, `surface:<tag>` or `volume:<tag>`. An Abaqus
/// `*NSET` becomes a node set, an `*ELSET` (or the `ELSET=` of an `*ELEMENT`
/// card) an element set when it holds cells and a node set when it holds
/// boundary elements.
///
/// Boundary conditions, loads and materials in an .inp file are not imported
/// - the SparLab deck defines those - and the report lists the ignored
/// keywords so nothing is dropped silently.
