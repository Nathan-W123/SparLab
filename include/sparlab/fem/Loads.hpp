/// \brief Volume loads - self-weight, body forces, rotation - and thermal
///        loads of a continuum model; self-weight and body forces of a shell
///        or a beam.
///
/// **Body loads from the consistent mass.** A body force density that is
/// affine in position, \f$b(x) = b_0 + B x\f$, is interpolated exactly by the
/// shape functions of any isoparametric element,
/// \f$b(x(\xi)) = \sum_b N_b(\xi)\,b(x_b)\f$, because the element maps
/// \f$x(\xi) = \sum_b N_b(\xi)\,x_b\f$ exactly. Its consistent nodal forces are
/// therefore
/// \f[
///   f_a = \int_{\Omega_e} N_a\,b\,dV = \sum_b \Big(\int_{\Omega_e} N_a N_b\,dV\Big)\,b(x_b)
///       = (M_e^{(1)}\,\hat b)_a ,
/// \f]
/// the unit-density consistent mass matrix times the nodal values of \f$b\f$ -
/// exact to the mass matrix's own quadrature, on curved Tet10 cells too.
/// Self-weight is the constant \f$b = \rho g\f$, a uniform body force density is
/// constant, and the centrifugal load of a rotation \f$\omega\f$ about an axis
/// through \f$c\f$ with direction \f$e\f$ is the affine
/// \f$b = \rho\,\omega^2 (I - e e^T)(x - c)\f$. The resultant of self-weight is
/// the model's mass times \f$g\f$ to round-off, which the tests check.
///
/// **Shells.** The shell's displacement interpolation (Shell4.hpp) with every
/// nodal rotation zero and every translation \f$b\f$ is \f$b\f$ at every point
/// of its volume, so for a constant \f$b\f$ - self-weight, a uniform body force
/// - \f$M_e^{(1)}\hat b\f$ with the rotations of \f$\hat b\f$ zero is again
/// \f$\int N^T b\,dV\f$ exactly, the moment a curved shell's volume gives it
/// about the mid-surface included. The centrifugal load changes through the
/// thickness in a way nodal values cannot carry, so a shell refuses it.
///
/// **Beams.** Likewise the beam's interpolation (Beam2.hpp) of equal nodal
/// translations and zero rotations is that translation along the whole
/// element, its rotation zero, so \f$M_e^{(1)}\hat b\f$ is the consistent load
/// of the uniform line load \f$A b\f$ exactly. The centrifugal load varies
/// over the section, and a beam refuses it too.
///
/// **Thermal loads.** A temperature change \f$\Delta T(x) = N^T (T_e - T_{ref})\f$
/// induces the free strain \f$\varepsilon_0 = \alpha\Delta T\f$ (Voigt form per
/// idealisation, IsotropicMaterial.hpp). With \f$\sigma = D(Bu - \varepsilon_0)\f$
/// equilibrium reads \f$K u = f + f_{th}\f$ with
/// \f[
///   f_{th} = \int_{\Omega_e} B^T D\,\varepsilon_0\,t\,dV ,
/// \f]
/// integrated with the stiffness rule of the element, so that a field of
/// free expansion that the element can represent (a uniform or linear
/// \f$\Delta T\f$ on affine cells) is reproduced exactly with zero stress.
