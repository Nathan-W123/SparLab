/// \file Selector.hpp
/// \brief Geometric region selectors for boundary conditions, loads and passive
///        topology regions.
///
/// Selectors are geometric so that the *same* configuration block can be
/// applied to meshes of different resolution, and so that a topology extracted
/// from a density field can be re-constrained without re-authoring indices.
/// The one non-geometric primitive, `Group`, names a set carried by the mesh
/// itself (a Gmsh physical group, an Abaqus *NSET / *ELSET): the way to reach
/// a curved hole wall or a CAD face that no box describes. Sets are carried
/// into extracted sub-meshes, so the re-constraint property holds for them too.
/// Every primitive is written for three coordinates; on a 2-D mesh the z
/// coordinate of every node is zero, so the default z bounds (+-infinity) and
/// the default circle axis (z) make a 2-D deck read exactly as before.
///
/// A `SelectorGroup` is the union of its members, optionally complemented.
/// Tolerances are relative to the mesh diagonal so that degenerate boxes
/// (`xmin == xmax`) reliably capture a line (2-D) or plane (3-D) of nodes.
