/// \brief Displacement constraint and load specifications, and their
///        application to a DofManager / global force vector.
///
/// Sign convention: forces and displacements are positive along the global
/// +x / +y / +z axes. Tractions are given as a stress vector \f$\bar{t}\f$ [Pa]
/// in global components and are integrated over the selected boundary faces
/// (edges in 2-D), producing consistent nodal forces (not lumped ones).
///
/// Vectors are three-component throughout; on a 2-D model the z entry of a
/// force or traction must be zero and `fix_z` is an error, so a deck cannot
/// silently lose a component it thought it had applied.
