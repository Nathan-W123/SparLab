/// \brief Non-linear static analysis: large displacement and rotation by the
///        total Lagrangian formulation and J2 plasticity, solved by Newton's
///        method under load control (along a load path that may unload) or
///        along the equilibrium path by the arc-length method.
///
/// **Kinematics.** `finite` (the default) is the total Lagrangian
/// formulation of TotalLagrangian.hpp: large displacement and rotation.
/// `small_strain` keeps the linear strain \f$\varepsilon = Bu\f$ and the
/// undeformed geometry - no geometric stiffness, pressures on the undeformed
/// faces, the centrifugal load of the undeformed body - so that with elastic
/// materials it is the linear analysis and with plastic ones the classical
/// materially-non-linear-only analysis. The solver reports the rotation and
/// the neglected quadratic part of the Green strain, and warns when they are
/// not small.
///
/// **Plasticity.** A material with a yield stress (IsotropicMaterial.hpp) is
/// elastoplastic: its elements take the J2 return of Plasticity.hpp at every
/// integration point (Elastoplastic.hpp), in the linear strain or, with
/// finite kinematics, in the Green-Lagrange strain. Each point keeps the
/// internal variables of the last converged step; every iteration returns
/// from them (not from the last iterate), and a converged step commits the
/// new ones, so a rejected or halved step leaves no trace. The Q4 and Hex8
/// elements of an elastoplastic material use the mean dilatation (B-bar) by
/// default, which keeps them from locking under the isochoric plastic flow
/// (MeanDilatation).
///
/// **Equilibrium.** With the load factor \f$\lambda\f$ and the free DOFs of
/// the displacement \f$u\f$, the residual is
/// \f[
///   R(u, \lambda) = f_{int}(u, \lambda) - \lambda f_{dead}
///                 - f_{pressure}(u, \lambda) - f_{rotation}(u, \lambda) ,
/// \f]
/// * \f$f_{int}\f$ from TotalLagrangian.hpp, with a temperature change scaled
///   by \f$\lambda\f$;
/// * \f$f_{dead}\f$ the point loads, tractions, self-weight and body forces
///   of the load case - they keep their magnitude and direction;
/// * a pressure **follows** the deforming face by default: it is integrated
///   over the current face, \f$-\lambda p\int N a(x)\f$ with the area vector
///   of the deformed geometry, and contributes the (non-symmetric) load
///   stiffness of FaceGeometry.hpp to the tangent; `follower_pressure = false`
///   keeps it on the undeformed face;
/// * a rotation's centrifugal load acts at the deformed position,
///   \f$\lambda\rho\omega^2 (I - ee^T)(X + u - c)\f$, which is linear in
///   \f$u\f$ and softens the tangent by \f$\lambda\omega^2 M_\perp\f$ (spin
///   softening);
/// * prescribed displacements are scaled by \f$\lambda\f$ (under load
///   control; the arc-length method needs them homogeneous).
///
/// **Load control** steps \f$\lambda\f$ from 0 to 1 - or along a `load_path`
/// of turning points, such as \f$0 \to 1 \to 0\f$ to load and unload - and
/// solves each step by
/// Newton's method with the consistent tangent from the tangent predictor,
/// optionally with a line search on the energy; a step that fails to converge
/// (or inverts an element) is cut in half and retried, and a quickly
/// converging run lengthens its steps again. Past a limit point load control
/// either fails or lands silently on a distant branch of equilibria - a
/// snap-through, which is not quasi-static - so two more kinds of step are cut:
/// one whose iterations meet a tangent with a negative pivot although it
/// started from a stable state, and one whose converged state lies farther
/// from the tangent predictor than the predicted increment itself (on a
/// smooth path that distance shrinks with the step; across a limit point it
/// does not). A run that no halving gets past stops and names the cause. The
/// second test is made only for elastic materials with finite kinematics:
/// the elastic predictor of a step in which points start to yield
/// underestimates the increment by the ratio of elastic to plastic
/// stiffness, and small-strain kinematics has no distant branches to jump
/// to. Beyond a plastic collapse load (no hardening) there is no equilibrium
/// at all, and load control stops with the last converged load below it.
/// **Arc-length** (Crisfield's cylindrical form) constrains the norm of
/// the displacement increment instead, so it follows the path through limit
/// points - snap-through, snap-back of the load - where load control must
/// fail; the arc length adapts to the iteration count, and the root of the
/// constraint closest to the previous direction is taken.
///
/// **Convergence** of an iteration requires both
/// \f$\|R_f\| \le \epsilon_R \max(\|f_{ext}\|, \|r_p\|)\f$ (the external load
/// or, under pure displacement control, the reactions) and
/// \f$\|\delta u\| \le \epsilon_u \|\Delta u\|\f$ for the step increment - or
/// the residual at its round-off floor. Under load control a line search on
/// the energy along the Newton direction guards each iteration. Every
/// converged step records the load factor, the iterations, the residual,
/// the monitored displacements and reactions and - from the \f$LDL^T\f$
/// factor of a symmetric tangent - the number of negative pivots, which by
/// Sylvester's law of inertia counts the negative eigenvalues: a positive
/// count on a load path means the state is unstable (past a limit or
/// bifurcation point). A follower-pressure tangent that is symmetric once
/// assembled (the rim of the loaded surface held) is factorised as such.
