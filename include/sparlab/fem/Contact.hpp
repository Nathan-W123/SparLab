/// \brief Unilateral contact in the non-linear static analysis: a surface of
///        the model against a rigid obstacle given analytically, or against
///        another surface of the model; frictionless or with Coulomb friction.
///
/// **Assumptions.** Small displacements and small sliding: the contact
/// geometry - the normals, the pairing of the two surfaces and the weights
/// below - is that of the reference configuration, and the gap is linear in
/// the displacement, which is the classical Signorini problem. It holds with
/// the `small_strain` kinematics of the non-linear analysis (linear
/// elasticity or J2 plasticity), and the analysis refuses `finite`
/// kinematics with contact. Linear elements only (Q4, Tri3, Hex8, Tet4): the
/// face of a Tet10 has zero corner weights `int N dA`, for which the dual
/// basis below does not exist.
///
/// **Discretisation (dual mortar).** On the slave surface the contact
/// pressure is interpolated with the dual basis \f$\psi_j\f$ of each face
/// (Wohlmuth), biorthogonal to its shape functions:
/// \f$\int \psi_j N_k\,dA = \delta_{jk} D_j\f$, \f$D_j = \int N_j\,dA\f$.
/// The contact force on slave node j is then \f$D_j\,p_j\,\nu_j\f$ alone
/// (\f$\nu_j\f$ the direction of the pressure on the slave body, into it),
/// and on master node l \f$-\sum_j M_{jl}\,p_j\,\nu_j\f$ with
/// \f$M_{jl} = \int \psi_j N_l^{m}\,dA\f$ over the slave surface, the master
/// shape function taken at the point the slave normal field projects to
/// (segment-by-segment in 2-D; on an auxiliary plane per slave face with
/// polygon clipping in 3-D, Puso and Laursen). The weighted gap
/// \f[
///   \tilde g_j = \tilde g_{0j} + D_j\,\nu_j\cdot u_j - \sum_l M_{jl}\,\nu_j\cdot u_l
/// \f]
/// must stay non-negative, \f$\tilde g_{0j} = \int\psi_j g_0\,dA\f$ the
/// weighted initial gap. Against a rigid obstacle \f$\nu_j\f$ is the
/// obstacle's normal at the node, \f$\tilde g_j = D_j\,(g(X_j) + \nu_j \cdot
/// (u_j - \lambda d))\f$ with the obstacle moved by \f$\lambda d\f$ - exact on
/// a flat obstacle, and a consistent nodal rule on a curved one.
///
/// **Solution.** The pressure is condensed: slave node j's equilibrium gives
/// \f$p_j = \nu_{F}\cdot R_{F}/(D_j |\nu_F|^2)\f$ from the residual
/// \f$R = f_{int} - f_{ext}\f$ of its free components F, so Newton's method
/// works on the displacements alone. A semismooth Newton method (primal-dual
/// active set, Hueber and Wohlmuth) decides the contact status from the
/// complementarity function: node j is in contact where
/// \f$p_j - c\,\tilde g_j / D_j > 0\f$, \f$c = E / h\f$. In contact its
/// normal equation becomes \f$\tilde g_j = 0\f$; open, \f$p_j = 0\f$. With
/// Coulomb friction (coefficient \f$\mu\f$) and the tangential traction
/// \f$\lambda_\tau\f$ taken in the direction of the slip, a contact node
/// sticks where \f$|\lambda_\tau + c\,\tilde u_\tau / D_j| < \mu p_j\f$ -
/// its weighted slip increment over the step \f$\tilde u_\tau\f$ is then zero
/// - and slips otherwise, with \f$\lambda_\tau = \mu p_j\f$ along
/// \f$\lambda_\tau + c\,\tilde u_\tau / D_j\f$. The master equations take the
/// condensed contact forces of their slave nodes.
///
/// **The Newton step.** While no node slips under friction, the step is that
/// of a symmetric problem: with the dual basis each slave node's constraints
/// (its gap; sticking, its slip too) involve only its own and its master
/// nodes' displacements, so they fix some of its own increments in terms of
/// the others, \f$\Delta u_f = T w + c\f$ over the independent increments w,
/// and the step solves the symmetric positive-definite \f$T^T K_{ff} T\,w =
/// -T^T (R_f + K_{ff}\,c)\f$ - by LDL^T, or multigrid CG for a large model
/// (`solver`, as a static solve). A slipping node's friction law makes the
/// step non-symmetric: the condensed system is then solved by sparse LU.
/// Both give the same step. For linear elasticity without friction the
/// active set is exact after finitely many iterations and the solution then
/// exact to round-off.
