/// \brief Linear (eigenvalue) buckling analysis of the constrained model.
///
/// A load case \f$f\f$ produces the displacement \f$u\f$ of \f$K u = f\f$ and
/// with it a stress field \f$\sigma = D B u\f$. Linearised buckling asks for
/// which multiple \f$\lambda\f$ of that stress state the stiffness loses
/// definiteness:
/// \f[
///   \left(K_{ff} + \lambda\, K_{G,ff}(u)\right)\phi = 0,
/// \f]
/// where \f$K_G\f$ is the geometric (initial-stress) stiffness
/// (`Element::geometric_stiffness`). The structure is predicted to buckle at
/// the load \f$\lambda f\f$: \f$\lambda > 1\f$ is a safety factor on the
/// reference load, \f$\lambda < 1\f$ means it buckles before reaching it. A
/// compressive stress makes \f$K_G\f$ negative in the direction of the
/// buckling mode; a tensile one stiffens, and a load case that only
/// stiffens the structure has no positive \f$\lambda\f$ at all (the
/// reversed load may still buckle it, at a negative \f$\lambda\f$).
///
/// **Assumptions.** Linear elasticity up to buckling, small pre-buckling
/// rotations (the pre-buckling state is the linear solution, scaled), loads
/// that keep their direction (no follower forces), and a perfect geometry:
/// \f$\lambda\f$ is the bifurcation load of the ideal structure and is an
/// upper bound on the collapse load of a real, imperfect one. It is a
/// stability *check*, not a post-buckling analysis.
///
/// **Algorithm.** With the positive definite \f$K\f$ on the right-hand side,
/// \f$\mu = 1/\lambda\f$ solves the symmetric-definite pencil
/// \f$(-K_G)\phi = \mu K \phi\f$, and the smallest positive load factors are
/// its largest eigenvalues. Subspace iteration on
/// \f$X \leftarrow K^{-1}(-K_G)X\f$ with a Rayleigh-Ritz projection onto the
/// \f$q = \min(n, \max(2m, m+8))\f$-dimensional subspace finds them with
/// the factorisation of \f$K_{ff}\f$ the static solve already made. But
/// \f$-K_G\f$ is indefinite: negative \f$\mu\f$ - load factors of the
/// reversed load - converge alongside, and when more of them than the spare
/// \f$q - m - 2\f$ slots exceed the wanted eigenvalues in magnitude (a
/// structure mostly in tension, or near-void SIMP material in tension) the
/// wanted ones cannot converge. The iteration then switches to the buckling
/// spectral transformation (Grimes, Lewis and Simon 1994),
/// \f$X \leftarrow (K + \sigma K_G)^{-1} K X\f$ with eigenvalues
/// \f$\nu = \lambda / (\lambda - \sigma)\f$: above 1 for the load factors
/// beyond \f$\sigma\f$ and in (0, 1) for every negative one, whatever its
/// size. For \f$0 < \sigma < \lambda_1\f$ the shifted matrix is positive
/// definite, and by Sylvester's law of inertia the number of negative pivots
/// of its \f$LDL^T\f$ factorisation equals the number of load factors in
/// \f$(0, \sigma)\f$; that count places \f$\sigma\f$ below \f$\lambda_1\f$
/// (lowered by halving from an estimate, or grown by factors of 8 from the
/// load case itself), and \f$\sigma\f$ is raised once to 0.8 of the settled
/// \f$\lambda_1\f$. A load case with no positive load factor below
/// \f$10^{15}\f$ is reported as only stiffening. The shifted factorisation
/// is a sparse \f$LDL^T\f$ whatever `linear` selects. Convergence requires
/// both the relative change of the requested load factors and every
/// eigenpair residual \f$\|K\phi + \lambda K_G\phi\| / \|K\phi\|\f$ below
/// their tolerances.
/// Systems with at most 400 free DOFs use a dense generalised eigensolve.
/// Modes are normalised to \f$\phi^T K \phi = 1\f$, the normalisation of the
/// sensitivity formula in BucklingConstraint.hpp, and returned full length
/// with zeros at prescribed DOFs.
///
/// **Density fields.** For a SIMP design `stiffness_scale` holds
/// \f$E_K(\rho)/E_0\f$ and `stress_scale` the factor of the stress that
/// enters \f$K_G\f$; with the same factor in both, void regions carry
/// artificial low-stiffness "pseudo" buckling modes, which is why the
/// topology optimiser passes \f$\rho^p\f$ without the \f$E_{min}\f$ floor
/// (see BucklingConstraint.hpp). The fraction of each mode's strain energy
/// in solid elements is reported so a void-localised mode is visible.
