/// \file Multigrid.hpp
/// \brief Smoothed-aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) and the
///        preconditioned conjugate gradient method built on it.
///
/// A sparse Cholesky factorisation of a 3-D stiffness matrix fills in: its
/// cost grows like \f$n^{2}\f$ and its memory like \f$n^{4/3}\f$, which is
/// what capped the solid models of this code base at a few tens of thousands
/// of unknowns. Conjugate gradients needs only matrix-vector products, and
/// with a multigrid preconditioner the iteration count stays nearly constant
/// as the mesh is refined, so the whole solve scales close to linearly.
///
/// ### Hierarchy (Vanek, Mandel and Brezina, 1996)
/// On each level \f$\ell\f$, starting from the reduced stiffness matrix
/// \f$A_0 = K_{ff}\f$:
///
///  1. **Strength of connection** between the unknowns' nodes \f$I, J\f$
///     uses the Frobenius norms of the matrix blocks,
///     \f$ \|A_{IJ}\|_F \ge \theta \sqrt{\|A_{II}\|_F \|A_{JJ}\|_F} \f$.
///     Weak links - between solid and SIMP void material, for instance -
///     are ignored when aggregating.
///  2. **Aggregation** groups each node with its strongly connected
///     neighbours (greedy, in node order, three passes), so an aggregate is a
///     small patch of the mesh.
///  3. **Tentative prolongator** \f$\hat P\f$: the near-null space \f$B\f$ -
///     the rigid-body modes (2 translations and 1 rotation in 2-D, 3 and 3 in
///     3-D), which the stiffness matrix barely resists - is restricted to each
///     aggregate and orthonormalised by a rank-revealing QR,
///     \f$B_a = Q_a R_a\f$. \f$Q_a\f$ is the aggregate's block of \f$\hat P\f$
///     and \f$R_a\f$ its rows of the coarse near-null space, so
///     \f$\hat P B_c = B\f$ exactly: the coarse space represents every
///     rigid-body motion of every aggregate.
///  4. **Prolongator smoothing** \f$P = (I - \omega D^{-1} A)\hat P\f$ with
///     \f$\omega = \tfrac{4}{3} / \lambda_{max}(D^{-1}A)\f$ (Lanczos
///     estimate), which lowers the energy of the coarse basis functions.
///  5. **Galerkin coarse operator** \f$A_{\ell+1} = P^T A_\ell P\f$
///     (symmetrised), which keeps every level symmetric positive definite.
///
/// The recursion stops at `coarse_size` unknowns, where a dense Cholesky
/// factorisation solves exactly. A coarse operator that is not positive
/// definite means a rigid-body mode survived to the coarse level - the model
/// is under-constrained - and is reported as such.
///
/// ### Cycle and Krylov method
/// One V-cycle with a symmetric smoother (Chebyshev polynomial in
/// \f$D^{-1}A\f$, or a forward / backward Gauss-Seidel pair) is a symmetric
/// positive-definite preconditioner, so the outer method is plain
/// preconditioned CG, stopped when \f$\|b - A x\|_2 \le \text{tol}\,
/// \|b\|_2\f$. An initial guess (the previous design iteration's
/// displacement, the previous subspace iterate) can be supplied.
///
/// ### Determinism
/// Every kernel is either row-parallel with rows written independently
/// (matrix-vector products, the sparse matrix-matrix products of the setup,
/// the Chebyshev smoother) or sequential (Gauss-Seidel, aggregation), and
/// every inner product sums fixed-size chunks in a fixed order. Results are
/// therefore bitwise identical for any number of OpenMP threads.
