"""Cross-validate SparLab's static solution against two independent FE codes.

usage:
    python3 python/scripts/cross_validate.py \

        --output results/cross_validation

For every result directory given (a `sparlab_solve` run made with
`--export-calculix`), the same discrete problem - identical mesh, element type,
material, consistent nodal loads and prescribed DOFs, all read from the run's
own `mesh.json` and CalculiX decks - is solved by

  * CalculiX (`ccx`), from the exported `calculix_<load case>.inp`, and
  * scikit-fem, assembled in this script from `mesh.json` with the linear
    isotropic elasticity form on ElementQuad1 / ElementHex1 / ElementTriP1 /
    ElementTetP1, and on ElementTetP2 over an isoparametric MeshTet2 for the
    quadratic tetrahedra (curved cells included),

and the nodal displacements are compared with SparLab's `displacement_<load
case>.csv` node by node. Reported per code and load case:

  * `max_abs_diff_m`, `max_rel_diff` = max |u_ref - u| / max |u|, and the RMS
    of the same ratio,
  * `ref_max_abs_m` and `sparlab_max_abs_m`,
  * pass/fail against the tolerance stated in the output.

Two things are deliberately measured rather than assumed. scikit-fem uses the
same element formulation, so it agrees to the level the two linear solvers
agree (1e-10 and better); the tolerance is 1e-7. CalculiX writes its nodal
results to the .frd file with six significant digits, so even for C3D8 - the
same element as SparLab's Hex8 - the comparison is bounded below by that
rounding: half a unit in the sixth digit of the largest displacement, 5e-6
relative. The same holds for C3D4, the linear tetrahedron, and for C3D10, the
quadratic one (four-point stiffness integration, as in SparLab). The CalculiX
tolerance is therefore 1e-5 for every element family, and the summary records
the rounding floor next to the measured difference. CalculiX's plane elements
(CPS4, CPS3) are *expanded* into solids through the thickness with the
plane-stress condition imposed on the expanded element, which is a different
discretisation of the plane problem. In plane stress it coincides with
SparLab's element only for a Poisson ratio of zero: measured on the Gmsh lug
bracket, CPS3 agrees to the .frd rounding floor at nu = 0 (2.8e-6) and differs
by about 1e-3 at nu = 0.33. A plane-stress comparison with nu != 0 is
therefore reported as an informational comparison between two idealisations,
and scikit-fem - the same plane element - is the verification for those
cases. The plane-strain expansion (CPE4, CPE3) holds the out-of-plane
displacement at zero and is exact: the two-material plate agrees to 2.1e-6
at nu = 0.3 / 0.33, so plane-strain comparisons are judged.

Loads beyond point loads and tractions are exported in CalculiX's own form -
pressure faces (P), self-weight (GRAV), body forces (BX/BY/BZ), rotation
(CENTRIF), and a temperature field through *EXPANSION and *TEMPERATURE - so the
CalculiX comparison of such a case also tests SparLab's integration of those
loads, not only its stiffness and solve. A case whose temperature is conducted
has a second deck, a steady *HEAT TRANSFER job that CalculiX solves itself;
its nodal temperatures (NT) are compared with SparLab's, relative to the
temperature range of the field.

scikit-fem makes two comparisons. It solves with SparLab's assembled load
vector (mesh.json), a check of the stiffness - per element material, for a
model with several - and of the solve; and, for a deck with such loads, it
integrates them itself from the same deck CalculiX reads ("scikit-fem loads"):
body forces and pressures with order-6 rules (exact on straight cells, as
SparLab's are), the thermal load with SparLab's rule (the element's stiffness
rule: four points for the Tet10, exact for the linear elements). Two
formulation choices of CalculiX differ from SparLab's and are reproduced in
scikit-fem so that CalculiX is judged against its own problem, with its
difference to SparLab recorded beside it: CalculiX takes the element-average
temperature for the thermal strain of a first-order hexahedron (C3D8, and the
hexahedra of an expanded CPS4 / CPE4), and integrates the centrifugal load of
a C3D10 with its four-point rule, which is not exact for that cubic integrand
(SparLab's consistent-mass integration is). Both were measured, not assumed:
reproducing them brings CalculiX to within 1e-6 to 4e-6 of scikit-fem. A third
shows on curved geometry only: CalculiX integrates a pressure on the six-node
face of a C3D10 with a three-point rule, exact on a flat face but not for the
degree-4 integrand of a curved one, whose load SparLab integrates exactly.

A run with a `transient` or `frequency_response` block is also integrated
again in time, or solved at every frequency, by scikit-fem and (transients on
solid elements) by CalculiX's *DYNAMIC: see dynamics_xval.py.

A run with contact is compared through its non-linear analysis (its linear
static one is of the model without contact, and absent where only the
contact holds a body): scikit-fem solves the same discrete contact problem
with its own mortar integrals and an uncondensed semismooth Newton method
(contact_xval.py), and, for a solid model whose contact CalculiX can
represent - mortar pairs and flat rigid obstacles - CalculiX's linear dual
mortar contact (LINMORTAR) solves the exported deck. CalculiX takes the
contact geometry at the start of every increment, so the decks it checks
run in one (a second moves its answer off the small-sliding problem by the
order of the displacement over the body size: 2.3e-4 of the displacement,
measured).

Nothing here recomputes SparLab's numbers: they are read from the run.
