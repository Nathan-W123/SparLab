# Mathematical formulation

This document states exactly what SparLab solves. Notation follows
`docs/conventions.md`; every equation below is implemented in the file named
beside it.

## 1. Continuum problem

Small-strain linear elasticity on a domain `Omega` - a plane of constant
out-of-plane thickness `t` (2-D) or a solid (3-D, where `t = 1` everywhere
below) - with displacement boundary `Gamma_u` and traction boundary `Gamma_t`:

```
  div sigma + b = 0            in Omega          (equilibrium)
  eps = 1/2 (grad u + grad u^T)                  (kinematics)
  sigma = D : eps                                (constitutive)
  u = u_bar                    on Gamma_u
  sigma . n = t_bar            on Gamma_t
```

Body forces `b` are not implemented; loads enter as boundary tractions and
concentrated nodal forces. The weak form, for all admissible `v`, is

```
  integral_Omega  t eps(v)^T D eps(u) dOmega
      =  integral_Gamma_t  t v^T t_bar dGamma  +  sum_k v(x_k)^T F_k
```

with the second term the point loads.

### Plane idealisations

With Voigt ordering `{sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_xy}` and
`{eps_xx, eps_yy, gamma_xy}` (`gamma_xy = 2 eps_xy`), an isotropic material
gives (`material/IsotropicMaterial.cpp`):

**Plane stress** (`sigma_zz = 0`; a thin sheet loaded in its plane)

```
           E     | 1    nu       0     |
  D  =  -------- | nu    1       0     |
        1 - nu^2 | 0     0  (1-nu)/2   |
```

**Plane strain** (`eps_zz = 0`; a long prismatic body, or a plane of symmetry)

```
                 E          | 1-nu   nu        0      |
  D  =  ------------------   | nu    1-nu       0      |
        (1+nu)(1-2nu)        | 0      0    (1-2nu)/2   |
```

In plane strain the out-of-plane stress is `sigma_zz = nu (sigma_xx + sigma_yy)`
and the von Mises formula must use it; `fem/StressRecovery.cpp` does.

The `(3,3)` entry of both matrices equals the shear modulus
`G = E / (2(1+nu))`, which is a consequence of pairing Voigt stress with
*engineering* shear strain and is checked in the test suite.

Both idealisations are implemented and unit-tested. Plane stress is the default
on a plane mesh and is the path the plane benchmark and verification studies
exercise.

### Three dimensions

On a solid (`structured_hex`) mesh the full isotropic law is used, with Voigt
ordering `{sigma_xx, sigma_yy, sigma_zz, sigma_xy, sigma_yz, sigma_zx}` and
the three engineering shear strains. In terms of the Lame constants
`lambda = E nu / ((1+nu)(1-2nu))` and `G = E / (2(1+nu))`,

```
        | lambda+2G   lambda     lambda    0  0  0 |
        | lambda    lambda+2G    lambda    0  0  0 |
  D  =  | lambda      lambda   lambda+2G   0  0  0 |          (6 x 6)
        |    0          0         0        G  0  0 |
        |    0          0         0        0  G  0 |
        |    0          0         0        0  0  G |
```

which the test suite checks entry by entry against this Lame form, and whose
von Mises reduction it checks against uniaxial, hydrostatic (zero) and
pure-shear (`sqrt(3) tau`) states. There is no thickness: a solid deck rejects
`model.thickness`.

## 2. Element formulation

### Shape functions

The four-node bilinear isoparametric quadrilateral (`elements/Quad4.cpp`), on
the reference square `(xi, eta) in [-1,1]^2`:

```
  N_1 = 1/4 (1 - xi)(1 - eta)        N_3 = 1/4 (1 + xi)(1 + eta)
  N_2 = 1/4 (1 + xi)(1 - eta)        N_4 = 1/4 (1 - xi)(1 + eta)
```

with natural derivatives

```
  dN_1/dxi  = -1/4 (1 - eta)     dN_1/deta = -1/4 (1 - xi)
  dN_2/dxi  = +1/4 (1 - eta)     dN_2/deta = -1/4 (1 + xi)
  dN_3/dxi  = +1/4 (1 + eta)     dN_3/deta = +1/4 (1 + xi)
  dN_4/dxi  = -1/4 (1 + eta)     dN_4/deta = +1/4 (1 - xi)
```

These satisfy `sum_a N_a = 1` everywhere, `N_a = delta_ab` at node `b`, and
`sum_a grad N_a = 0` - all three are unit-tested.

### Isoparametric mapping

Geometry and displacement use the same basis:

```
  x(xi, eta) = sum_a N_a(xi, eta) x_a        u(xi, eta) = sum_a N_a(xi, eta) u_a
```

The Jacobian and its determinant are

```
  J_ij = dx_i / dxi_j = sum_a x_a,i  dN_a/dxi_j            (a 2 x 2 matrix)
  detJ = J_11 J_22 - J_12 J_21
```

`detJ <= 0` at any quadrature point means the element is inverted, collapsed or
wound clockwise, and raises `MeshError` naming the element and the parametric
point. Physical shape-function gradients follow from
`dN_a/dx = (dN_a/dxi) J^{-1}` (the 2x2 inverse is written out explicitly; the
assembly loop runs it millions of times).

### Strain-displacement operator

```
          | dN_1/dx    0     dN_2/dx    0     ...  |
  B  =    |   0     dN_1/dy     0    dN_2/dy  ...  |      (3 x 8)
          | dN_1/dy dN_1/dx  dN_2/dy dN_2/dx  ...  |
```

so `eps = B u_e` with `u_e` in node-major order. Because the Q4 space contains
all linear fields exactly, `B u_e` reproduces a constant strain field exactly at
*every* parametric point, on distorted meshes as well as uniform ones. That is
what the patch test checks, and it holds to round-off.

### Quadrature

Gauss-Legendre tensor-product rules on the reference square
(`elements/Quadrature.cpp`). An `n`-point rule per direction integrates
polynomials of degree `2n - 1` exactly.

| Kernel | Default rule | Why |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| Stiffness `K_e` | 2 x 2 (2 x 2 x 2 for the Hex8) | exact for the Q4 on a parallelogram and the Hex8 on a parallelepiped; full integration, no reduced-integration hourglass modes |
| Mass `M_e` | 3 x 3 (3 x 3 x 3) | `N^T N` is biquadratic, and on a general cell `detJ` is not constant |
| Edge / face traction | 2 points per direction | exact for a linear traction times a linear shape function |

All are configurable per run via `model.integration`. On a rectangle the 2x2,
3x3 and 4x4 stiffness matrices agree to round-off, which is unit-tested; the
same holds for the Hex8 on a box.

### Element matrices

```
  K_e = integral_Omega_e  t B^T D B  dOmega
      = sum_g  w_g  t  detJ(xi_g)  B(xi_g)^T D B(xi_g)              [N/m]

  M_e = integral_Omega_e  rho t N^T N dOmega
      = sum_g  w_g  rho t detJ(xi_g)  N(xi_g)^T N(xi_g)             [kg]
```

where `N` is the `2 x 8` shape-function matrix. Both are symmetrised after
integration, since any asymmetry is pure round-off.

`K_e` has exactly three zero eigenvalues - the two translations and the
infinitesimal rotation - and five strictly positive ones (six and eighteen
for the Hex8). Both parts of that statement are unit-tested on a uniform and
on a distorted element of each type.

Row-sum lumping of `M_e` gives the optional diagonal mass matrix. For the Q4 the
row sums add up to the exact element mass, so total mass is conserved either
way.

### Consistent edge loads

For an edge with end nodes `a`, `b` and a constant traction `t_bar`,

```
  f_e = integral_Gamma_e  t N^T t_bar ds
```

parametrised by `s in [-1,1]` with the constant Jacobian `|x_b - x_a| / 2`. For
a constant traction on a straight edge this splits the resultant evenly between
the two nodes, and the total is exactly `t_bar * (edge length) * t`. The test
suite checks the total is mesh independent under refinement.

### The trilinear hexahedron

On a solid mesh the element is the eight-node trilinear hexahedron
(`elements/Hex8.cpp`) on the reference cube `(xi, eta, zeta) in [-1,1]^3`,
nodes in the VTK order of `docs/conventions.md`:

```
  N_a = 1/8 (1 + xi_a xi)(1 + eta_a eta)(1 + zeta_a zeta),   (xi_a, eta_a, zeta_a) = +-1
```

The isoparametric mapping, the `3 x 3` Jacobian (inverted explicitly through
its adjugate; `detJ <= 0` raises `MeshError` naming the element and the
point) and the `6 x 24` strain-displacement operator

```
          | dN_a/dx     0        0     |
          |   0      dN_a/dy     0     |
  B_a  =  |   0         0     dN_a/dz  |        columns of node a, rows in the
          | dN_a/dy  dN_a/dx     0     |        order xx, yy, zz, xy, yz, zx
          |   0      dN_a/dz  dN_a/dy  |
          | dN_a/dz     0     dN_a/dx  |
```

follow the Q4 pattern exactly, and so do the checks: `sum_a N_a = 1`,
`sum_a grad N_a = 0`, exact reproduction of a linear field with six
independent constant strains on a distorted cell, `sum_g w_g detJ` against the
volume of a sheared box, `K_e` symmetric with exactly **six** zero eigenvalues
(three translations, three rotations) and the rest positive, and the 2x2x2
and 3x3x3 rules agreeing on a box. Face tractions integrate the
bilinear face `x(s, t)` with the area element `|x_s cross x_t|`, so a
constant traction on a flat face splits its resultant evenly over the four
corners and the total is exactly `t_bar * area` at any resolution.

The fully integrated Hex8 shares the Q4's stiffness in bending: it needs
several elements through a bending depth, which the 3-D mesh-convergence
study quantifies (`docs/verification.md`).

### The linear simplices

Meshes read from a mesh generator are mostly triangles and tetrahedra, so
SparLab also has the three-node triangle (`elements/Tri3.cpp`, plane) and
the four-node tetrahedron (`elements/Tet4.cpp`, solid). Their shape functions
are the barycentric coordinates, linear in `x`:

```
  Tri3:  N_a = (alpha_a + beta_a x + gamma_a y) / (2 A)
  Tet4:  N_a = (a_a + b_a x + c_a y + d_a z) / (6 V)
```

so `grad N_a` - and with it `B`, the strain and the stress - is constant over
the cell, and the element matrices have closed forms:

```
  K_e = t A B^T D B            (Tri3, B 3 x 6)
  K_e = V B^T D B              (Tet4, B 6 x 12)

  M_e = rho t A / 12 (1 + delta_ab) I_2      (Tri3, node blocks)
  M_e = rho V / 20 (1 + delta_ab) I_3        (Tet4, node blocks)
```

which is the exact consistent mass. A traction on a straight edge (a flat
triangular face) splits its resultant equally over the two (three) nodes. A
cell with non-positive area or volume raises `MeshError` naming the element
and its measure; the file readers re-order mirrored cells before that point,
so the error means a folded cell, not a node-order convention. Stresses are
reported at the centroid, which is exact for a constant-strain element.

The structured generators split each Q4 into two triangles, with the
diagonal alternating from cell to cell so there is no preferred direction,
and each Hex8 into the six Kuhn tetrahedra around its `0-6` diagonal, which
cuts every face of the grid along the same diagonal from both sides and so
stays conforming. The same box then exists as Q4, Tri3, Hex8 and Tet4 meshes
with identical nodes, which is what the simplex verification studies use.

Constant-strain elements lock in bending: a linear field cannot represent
the linearly varying strain through a beam's depth. They reproduce every
constant-strain state exactly (the patch test) but converge on a bending
problem more slowly per unknown than the bilinear and trilinear elements,
which the simplex mesh-convergence study measures (`docs/verification.md`).

### The quadratic tetrahedron

A part meshed from CAD is almost always a tetrahedral mesh, and on linear
tetrahedra it reads too stiff: the Tet4 above cannot bend. The ten-node
tetrahedron (`elements/Tet10.cpp`) adds a node on every edge. With the
barycentric coordinates `L_0 = 1 - xi - eta - zeta, L_1 = xi, L_2 = eta,
L_3 = zeta` of the reference cell,

```
  corners 0..3:     N_i  = L_i (2 L_i - 1)
  edge nodes 4..9:  N_ab = 4 L_a L_b     on the edges 0-1, 1-2, 2-0, 0-3, 1-3, 2-3
```

which is the VTK, Abaqus/CalculiX (C3D10) and scikit-fem node order; Gmsh
numbers the last two edge nodes the other way round and its reader swaps
them. The map `x(xi) = sum_a N_a x_a` is isoparametric, so an edge node may
sit off the straight edge on a curved CAD surface, as a Gmsh
`Mesh.ElementOrder = 2` mesh places it. On a straight-sided cell `grad N`
is linear, so the strain varies linearly and any quadratic displacement
field - pure bending among them - is reproduced exactly (the quadratic
patch test, `docs/verification.md`).

| Integral | Rule | Exact for |
|----------|------|-----------|
| stiffness `int B^T D B` and geometric stiffness | symmetric 4-point rule (degree 2), the rule of C3D10 | straight-sided cells |
| consistent mass `int rho N^T N` | 64-point collapsed Gauss (degree 5) | straight-sided cells |
| volume `int det J` | 27-point collapsed Gauss | any cell: `det J` is a cubic |
| face traction on a 6-node face | 16-point collapsed Gauss on `N^T t |x_,r x x_,s|` | flat faces: `S t / 3` on each edge node, nothing on the corners |

On a curved cell `B^T D B` is rational and the 4-point rule approximates it,
as every code using C3D10 does. The consistent mass matrix of the quadratic
tetrahedron has negative row sums at the corners, so a row-sum lumped mass
would be indefinite; lumping uses Hinton-Rock-Zienkiewicz scaling of the
diagonal instead, which on a straight cell gives each corner `m/36` and each
edge node `4m/27`. Element quality is the Tet4 measure of the corner
tetrahedron times the Jacobian ratio `min det J / max det J` over the ten
nodes (1 for a straight cell, falling as curved edges distort it); a cell
whose map folds at an integration point raises `MeshError`.

Two ways to a Tet10 mesh: read one (Abaqus/CalculiX `C3D10`, Gmsh element
type 11), or set `mesh.order: 2` on a tetrahedral deck, which elevates the
Tet4 mesh by putting a node at every edge midpoint (straight-sided cells;
the faceted geometry of the linear mesh stays). Boundary faces keep their
corner nodes as the key, so node sets and faces carry over.

## 3. Assembly

`fem/Assembler.cpp` builds a triplet list and compresses it to CSC:

```
  K = sum_e  s_e  A_e^T K_e^0 A_e            M = sum_e  m_e  A_e^T M_e^0 A_e
```

`A_e` is the (implicit) DOF gather operator, and `s_e`, `m_e` are per-element
scale factors: both are 1 for a plain analysis, and the topology optimizer
supplies `s_e = E(rho_e)/E_0` and a mass interpolation factor `m_e`.

On a **uniform structured mesh** all cells are geometrically identical, so
`K_e^0` and `M_e^0` are integrated once and reused; this is the dominant saving
in an optimisation loop. The generic per-element path is always available, and
the test suite asserts the two produce bit-comparable matrices.

Every assembly after the first reuses the **sparsity pattern**. The first
call records, per element, where each of its node blocks lands in the CSC
arrays of `K` (and of the reduced `K_ff`); later calls scatter the scaled
element matrices straight into those slots, in element order, which is the
order the triplet path sums duplicates in - so the result is bitwise
identical to `setFromTriplets`, which a test asserts, while skipping the sort
and the triplet storage. On the 830 115-DOF Hex8 block of the scaling
benchmark this took the assembly from 12.4 s to about 1 s and the peak memory
of the run from 4.8 GB to 3.9 GB. A zero scale factor on some element falls
back to the triplet path, whose pattern would differ.

## 4. Boundary conditions and the reduced system

Dirichlet conditions are applied by **partitioning**, not by penalty terms
(`fem/DofManager.cpp`, `fem/StaticAnalysis.cpp`). Splitting the DOFs into free
`f` and prescribed `p`,

```
  | K_ff  K_fp | | u_f |     | f_f     |
  |            | |     |  =  |         |
  | K_pf  K_pp | | u_p |     | f_p + r |
```

the first block row gives the system actually solved,

```
  K_ff u_f = f_f - K_fp u_p
```

and the reactions come from the *full* residual

```
  r = K u - f
```

whose entries at prescribed DOFs are the support reactions and whose entries at
free DOFs are the (tiny) solver residual. This gives exact reactions with no
second assembly, and keeps `K_ff` symmetric positive definite - no artificial
large diagonal entries to wreck the conditioning or the eigenvalue spectrum.

Because `K t = 0` for a rigid translation `t`, summing the residual over all
DOFs in one direction gives `sum(r) + sum(f) = 0` identically. That is the
global force balance every static result reports, and it is a genuine check on
the assembly and the solve rather than an identity of the post-processing.

## 5. Linear solvers

| Name | Implementation | Use |
|------|----------------|-----|
| `auto` (default) | `simplicial_ldlt` up to 50 000 free unknowns in 2-D and 10 000 in 3-D, `amg_cg` above | every deck that does not name a solver |
| `simplicial_ldlt` | Eigen `SimplicialLDLT` with AMD ordering | the reference; SPD systems; reports non-positive or tiny pivots as a singular system |
| `amg_cg` | CG preconditioned by SparLab's smoothed-aggregation multigrid (`fem/Multigrid.cpp`) | large systems, 3-D above all |
| `conjugate_gradient` | Eigen `ConjugateGradient`, Jacobi preconditioner | the baseline that shows what multigrid buys |
| `simplicial_llt` | Eigen `SimplicialLLT` with AMD | strictly SPD |
| `sparse_lu` | Eigen `SparseLU` with COLAMD | indefinite systems |
| `dense_lu` | Eigen `PartialPivLU` | verification of small models; refuses above 4000 DOFs |

After every solve the scaled residual `||A x - b|| / max(||b||, tiny)` is
compared with `solver.linear.residual_tolerance`. Exceeding it raises
`SolverError` with the measured value; a non-finite solution does the same. The
LDL^T path additionally inspects its pivots: a non-positive pivot, or a
`min/max` pivot ratio below `pivot_tolerance`, is reported as a singular system
together with the three modelling causes that usually produce it.

### Why an iterative solver

A sparse Cholesky factorisation of a 3-D stiffness matrix fills in. With a
nested-dissection-quality ordering its cost grows like `n^2` and its memory
like `n^(4/3)`, and the AMD ordering used here does somewhat worse: on the
Hex8 block of the scaling benchmark the factor holds about 560 entries per
unknown at 28 413 unknowns, against about 70 in `K` itself. Conjugate
gradients needs only products with `K`; the question is how many.
Preconditioned only by its diagonal, CG needs `O(sqrt(kappa))` iterations
and `kappa` grows like `h^-2`, so the count doubles with every halving of
the element size. A multigrid preconditioner keeps it nearly constant.

### Smoothed-aggregation multigrid

`fem/Multigrid.cpp` builds the hierarchy of Vanek, Mandel and Brezina (1996)
on `A_0 = K_ff`. On each level:

1. **strength of connection** between two nodes `I`, `J` compares the
   Frobenius norms of the matrix blocks,
   `||A_IJ||_F >= theta sqrt(||A_II||_F ||A_JJ||_F)` with `theta = 0.02`, so
   a weak link - solid next to SIMP void - does not glue two aggregates
   together;
2. **aggregation** groups each node with its strongly connected neighbours,
   greedily in node order in three passes;
3. **tentative prolongator.** The near-null space `B` is the rigid-body
   modes (two translations and a rotation in 2-D; three and three in 3-D),
   built from the node coordinates of the free unknowns. Restricted to each
   aggregate and orthonormalised by a rank-revealing QR, `B_a = Q_a R_a`,
   `Q_a` becomes the aggregate's block of `P_hat` and `R_a` its rows of the
   coarse near-null space, so `P_hat B_c = B` exactly - the coarse space
   represents every rigid motion of every aggregate;
4. **prolongator smoothing** `P = (I - omega D^-1 A) P_hat` with
   `omega = (4/3) / lambda_max(D^-1 A)`, the eigenvalue estimated by twelve
   Lanczos steps;
5. **Galerkin coarse operator** `A_{l+1} = P^T A_l P`, symmetrised, which
   keeps every level symmetric positive definite.

The recursion stops at 1500 unknowns, where a dense LDL^T factorisation
solves exactly. A coarsest pivot below `1e-13` of the largest means a rigid
body mode reached the coarse level - the model is under-constrained - and is
reported as such; the SIMP stiffness floor of `1e-9` stays orders of
magnitude above that.

One V-cycle, with a degree-3 Chebyshev smoother in `D^-1 A` on the interval
`[lambda_max / 30, 1.1 lambda_max]` before and after the coarse correction
(or a forward and a backward Gauss-Seidel sweep), is a symmetric
positive-definite operator, so the outer method is plain preconditioned CG,
stopped at `||b - A x|| <= tol ||b||` (`iterative_tolerance`, `1e-12` by
default). CG restarts from the true residual up to twice. When the
recursively updated residual meets the tolerance but the true residual
`b - A x` does not, and a restart no longer halves it, that is the accuracy
with which `b - A x` can be evaluated in floating point, and the solve is
accepted - the residual check above (`residual_tolerance`, `1e-8`) still
applies to it. A solve that exhausts its iteration budget raises
`ConvergenceError` naming the residual reached, the hierarchy and the keys
to change.

**In an optimisation loop** the matrix changes every iteration but its
pattern does not. The aggregates, the tentative prolongators and the
sparsity of every product are kept (`reuse_aggregates`), and only the
numerical part - smoothing, the Galerkin products, the smoother bounds and
the coarse factorisation - is redone; a test checks the reused hierarchy
equals a fresh one bit for bit. Each state and adjoint solve starts from the
previous iteration's solution of the same load case (`warm_start`).

**Determinism.** Every parallel kernel either writes rows independently
(matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products, the Chebyshev smoother) or runs
sequentially (aggregation, Gauss-Seidel), and every inner product sums
fixed-size chunks in a fixed order, so results are bitwise identical for any
number of OpenMP threads, which a test asserts.

The measured behaviour - iteration counts under refinement, time and memory
against the direct solver, agreement with it - is in `docs/verification.md`
and `docs/benchmarks.md`.

## 6. Stress recovery

```
  eps_e = B(xi_g) u_e                  sigma_e = s_e D eps_e
```

Element values are the average over the stiffness quadrature points; nodal
values are area-weighted averages of the adjacent element values (simple
averaging, used for smooth contours only - not a superconvergent patch
recovery). With `s_e` applied the result is the *macroscopic* stress carried by
the element, and the unscaled solid-material stress is reported alongside it.

Derived quantities:

```
  sigma_vm = sqrt( 1/2 [ (sxx-syy)^2 + (syy-szz)^2 + (szz-sxx)^2 ] + 3 (sxy^2 + syz^2 + szx^2) )
  szz = 0                            (plane stress;  syz = szx = 0 in both plane cases)
  szz = nu (sxx + syy)               (plane strain)

  sigma_{1,2} = (sxx+syy)/2  +-  sqrt( ((sxx-syy)/2)^2 + sxy^2 )          (plane)
  sigma_{1,2,3} = eigenvalues of the symmetric 3 x 3 stress tensor         (solid)

  U_e = 1/2 s_e u_e^T K_e^0 u_e      (element strain energy, exact)
```

On a solid mesh the three principal stresses come from a self-adjoint
eigen-decomposition of the stress tensor, and the test suite checks that
their sum, the sum of their pairwise products and their product reproduce the
three stress invariants.

## 7. Modal analysis

Undamped free vibration on the free DOFs (`fem/ModalAnalysis.cpp`):

```
  K_ff phi = lambda M_ff phi ,    lambda = omega^2 ,    f = omega / (2 pi)
```

Prescribed DOFs are removed by the same partitioning as the static solve, so no
constrained DOF can contribute a spurious mode.

**Algorithm.** Bathe subspace iteration with optional shift-invert. With
`q = min(n, max(2m, m+8))` trial vectors,

```
  Xbar_{k+1} = (K_ff - sigma M_ff)^{-1} M_ff X_k
  K_r = Xbar^T K_ff Xbar ,   M_r = Xbar^T M_ff Xbar          (q x q, dense)
  solve  K_r Q = mu M_r Q ,   X_{k+1} = Xbar Q
```

One sparse Cholesky factorisation serves every iteration and every vector. The
starting basis is deterministic: the mass diagonal, then unit vectors at the
DOFs with the largest `m_ii / k_ii` ratio, then a seeded PRNG if more are
needed. Because `Q^T M_r Q = I`, the rotated basis is automatically
M-orthonormal, and the modes are renormalised at the end so `phi^T M phi = 1`
holds to round-off.

For systems with 400 or fewer free DOFs a dense
`GeneralizedSelfAdjointEigenSolver` is used instead: it is faster at that size
*and* gives the test suite an independent reference for the iterative path. The
two agree to 1e-8 relative on a 40x8 cantilever.

**Stopping rule.** Both the relative eigenvalue change and every eigenpair
residual `||K phi - lambda M phi|| / ||lambda M phi||` must be below their
tolerances. Including the residual matters because the highest requested mode
converges last: its eigenvalue can look settled while its vector is not.

**Validity screening.** Each converged pair is checked for a non-finite
eigenvalue (error), a negative eigenvalue beyond round-off (error - `K_ff` is
not positive definite, which is impossible for a properly constrained
linear-elastic model), and an eigenvalue indistinguishable from zero at the
problem's stiffness/mass scale (warning - an unsuppressed rigid-body or
mechanism mode).

**Mass conservation.** Summing every entry of the assembled mass matrix gives
`sum(M) = dim * rho V`, one factor per translation direction (2 on a plane
mesh, 3 on a solid one). This identity is exact for both the consistent and
the lumped matrix and is used as a verification check (measured error
`<= 5e-14` in both dimensions).

### Analytical references

Two independent closed forms are used as validation references:

```
  bending, fixed-free beam:   f_n = (beta_n L)^2 / (2 pi L^2) sqrt(E h^2 / (12 rho))
                              beta_1 L = 1.87510407, beta_2 L = 4.69409113, ...

  axial, fixed-free rod:      f_n = (2n - 1) / (4 L) sqrt(E / rho)
```

The axial reference is *exact* for a bar in uniaxial stress, which plane stress
at `nu = 0` reproduces exactly; the measured agreement is 4e-6 relative. The
bending reference is not exact for a 2-D model, because Euler-Bernoulli theory
omits the shear deformation and rotary inertia the 2-D model includes - so the
computed frequencies must sit slightly *below* theory, and the gap must grow
with mode number. Both behaviours are asserted in the test suite, which is
stronger than asserting agreement.

## 7b. Linear buckling

`fem/Buckling.cpp`. A load case `f` gives the linear displacement `K u = f`
and with it the stress `sigma = D B u`. Linear (bifurcation) buckling asks
for which multiple `lambda` of that stress state the stiffness loses
definiteness:

```
  (K_ff + lambda K_G,ff(u)) phi = 0 ,
  K_G,e(u_e) = int_e t G^T S(sigma) G dOmega ,   S = blockdiag(sigma, ..., sigma)
```

with `G` the matrix of shape-function gradients (so that `phi^T K_G phi =
int sigma_ij phi_k,i phi_k,j`), integrated with the element's stiffness
rule. The structure is predicted to buckle at the load `lambda f`: `lambda
> 1` is a safety factor on the load case, `lambda < 1` means it buckles
before reaching it. A load that only stretches the structure has no
positive `lambda` and is reported so (the reversed load may buckle it at a
negative `lambda`). Assumptions: linear elasticity up to buckling, the
pre-buckling state is the linear solution scaled, loads keep their
direction, and the geometry is perfect - `lambda` is the bifurcation load
of the ideal structure, an upper bound on the collapse load of a real one.

**Algorithm.** `mu = 1/lambda` solves the symmetric-definite pencil
`(-K_G) phi = mu K phi`, and the smallest positive load factors are its
largest eigenvalues. Subspace iteration on `X <- K^-1 (-K_G) X` with a
Rayleigh-Ritz projection onto `q = min(n, max(2m, m + 8))` vectors reuses
the factorisation of `K_ff` the static solve made. `-K_G` is indefinite,
so load factors of the reversed load converge alongside; when more of them
than the spare slots outrank the wanted ones - a structure mostly in
tension, or SIMP void in tension - the iteration switches to the buckling
spectral transformation (Grimes, Lewis and Simon 1994)

```
  X <- (K + sigma K_G)^-1 K X ,     nu = lambda / (lambda - sigma)
```

which maps every negative `lambda` into `(0, 1)` and the wanted ones above
1. For `0 < sigma < lambda_1` the shifted matrix is positive definite, and
by Sylvester's law of inertia the negative pivots of its `LDL^T`
factorisation count the load factors below `sigma`; that count places
`sigma`. Convergence needs both the relative change of the requested load
factors and every residual `||K phi + lambda K_G phi|| / ||K phi||` below
their tolerances (`1e-8`, `1e-6` by default). Systems with at most 400 free
DOFs use a dense generalised eigensolve. Modes are normalised to `phi^T K
phi = 1` and each carries the fraction of its strain energy in elements at
density `>= 0.5` (1 for a plain analysis), so a mode localised in void
material is visible.

Where it runs: `sparlab_solve --buckling n` (or a `buckling` deck section)
checks the analysed model; in a topology run the same section checks the
full solid domain and the exported part - the density thresholded at 0.5,
largest face-connected group, full material - after the optimisation. The
buckling constraint on the SIMP design is in `docs/topology_optimization.md`
(section 5d).

**Plane models.** A plane-stress model buckles only in its plane: a strut
of a 2-D design can buckle sideways within the plane, but a thin plate
cannot buckle out of it, which needs shell or solid elements.

## 8. Topology optimisation

See `docs/topology_optimization.md` for the SIMP interpolation, the filters, the
sensitivity derivation, the optimality-criteria and MMA updates, and the
aggregated stress constraint with its adjoint.

## 9. Cross-validation

The discrete problem a deck defines is exported verbatim - the same nodes,
connectivity, supports and consistent nodal loads - to CalculiX (`*.inp`,
elements CPS4/CPE4, CPS3/CPE3, C3D8, C3D4, C3D10) and rebuilt in scikit-fem
(`ElementQuad1`, `ElementTriP1`, `ElementHex1`, `ElementTetP1`, and
`ElementTetP2` on an isoparametric `MeshTet2` with the 4-point rule, with the
same Lame constants, `lambda* = 2 lambda G / (lambda + 2G)` for plane
stress), and the three nodal displacement fields are compared node by node.
Where the run computed buckling load factors, scikit-fem assembles the
geometric stiffness of its own static solution at the same quadrature
points and solves the pencil densely, and CalculiX runs the exported deck
as a `*BUCKLE` step; the load factors are compared mode by mode. CalculiX's
plane elements are not plane elements internally: it expands them into a
layer of solid elements, which reproduces plane stress only for `nu = 0`, so
a plane comparison at `nu != 0` compares two idealisations and is recorded
without being judged. `docs/verification.md` has the measured differences
and what they mean.
