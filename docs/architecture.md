# Architecture

## Layering

Each box is one directory. An arrow means "depends on"; there are no cycles and
no upward dependencies, so any layer can be replaced without touching the ones
below it.

   python/sparlab_viz/  reads only the files io/ writes:
       loaders -> style -> fields / solid -> plots / plots3d / studies
   python/scripts/cross_validate.py  drives CalculiX and scikit-fem on the
       exported decks and compares nodal displacements and buckling load
       factors
   python/scripts/make_meshes.py  generates the Gmsh meshes the
       real-geometry decks read (the meshes are committed)
   python/scripts/tet10_part_study.py  meshes the engine mount at several
       sizes and orders and compares Tet4 with Tet10
```

The core is dimension-generic at run time: `Mesh::dim()` is 2 or 3, the
element kernels are written for their own dimension (`Quad4` and `Tri3` on a
2-D, `Hex8`, `Tet4` and `Tet10` on a 3-D mesh) and everything above the element
layer - DOF
numbering, assembly, partitioning, stress recovery, modal analysis, the
optimiser, the writers - is written against `dim`, `nodes_per_element` and
the Voigt length rather than against a fixed 2. The Q4 kernels keep
fixed-size internal matrices, so the plane path produces bit-for-bit what it
did before the solid path existed - checked by re-running every benchmark
deck and comparing each summary, CSV and VTK file with the earlier output.

## Design decisions worth naming

**Dirichlet conditions by partitioning, not penalty.** The reduced system
`K_ff u_f = f_f - K_fp u_p` keeps `K_ff` symmetric positive definite, gives
exact reactions from the full residual `r = K u - f`, and leaves the eigenvalue
spectrum undistorted. A penalty method would have made the modal analysis wrong
in a way that is hard to notice.

**One factorisation per optimiser iteration.** `StaticAnalysis::prepare()`
factorises `K_ff` once and `solve_load_vector()` reuses it, so a three-load-case
design costs one factorisation and three back-substitutions per iteration rather
than three factorisations. Combined with self-adjointness (no adjoint solve for
the compliance gradient), that is what makes multi-load-case optimisation on a
38 000-element mesh a 5-minute job rather than an hour. With the multigrid
solver the same interface means one hierarchy update per iteration and one
warm-started CG solve per load case: the objective keeps its solver, and the
solver keeps its aggregates and each load case's last solution, between
iterations.

**A direct solver as the reference, multigrid for scale.** The committed 2-D
decks and the verification studies run on the sparse Cholesky factorisation,
whose answer does not depend on a tolerance - except the multigrid study
itself, and the two finest Tet4 meshes of the simplex convergence study,
where `auto` selects multigrid (the summary records which ran). The
multigrid CG solver is the
path to large 3-D models; it is verified against the direct solver (to the
iterative tolerance, on every element type) rather than trusted, and `auto`
switches to it only above a size where the factorisation's fill starts to
dominate. Writing the multigrid rather than linking one kept the build at
Eigen and a C++17 compiler, and let it use what the model knows - node
coordinates for the rigid-body near-null space, the DOF blocks for the
strength of connection - which a generic algebraic package would have to be
told.

**Assembly into a cached pattern.** An optimisation re-assembles a matrix
whose pattern never changes, hundreds of times. The first assembly records
where every element block lands; later ones scatter into those slots in
element order - the order the triplet path sums duplicates in - so the
matrix is bitwise identical, which a test asserts, and the per-assembly sort
and triplet storage disappear. On the largest scaling mesh that was the
difference between assembly dominating a multigrid solve and being a small
part of it.

**The projection defines the physical density.** With the Heaviside
projection on, `rho_bar` rather than the filtered density is what the SIMP
law, the volume constraint, the stress constraint, the grey level and the
interpretation see, and the chain rule runs through it for every function.
Nothing downstream needed to know whether the projection is on, and the
finite-difference verification covers the combination.

**A mesh file is checked, not trusted.** The readers treat a file from
another tool the way a reviewer would: unsupported and mixed cell types are
refused with the re-export that fixes them, orientation is repaired and
counted, unused and coincident nodes are reported, the unit scale is checked
for plausibility, and everything - including the keywords that were ignored -
lands in the summary. Named groups become node and element sets, so a deck
addresses `"group": "bolt_holes"` instead of coordinates that would break
the moment the geometry changes.

**Element-matrix cache for uniform grids.** On a uniform structured mesh every
cell is geometrically identical, so `K_e^0` and `M_e^0` are integrated once. The
generic per-element path is always compiled in and the test suite asserts the
two agree, so the optimisation cannot silently diverge from the general case.

**Purely geometric region selectors.** Boundary conditions, loads and passive
regions are all specified by geometry, never by node or element indices (though
indices are available). The same deck therefore applies unchanged at any mesh
resolution, and a topology extracted from a density field can be re-constrained
without re-authoring anything - which is what makes the static and modal
analysis of the interpreted structure possible at all. That re-analysis runs on
every topology job, because the compliance of the *thresholded* structure is
what the design would really deliver; if the extracted structure turns out not
to be analysable, the reason is recorded in the summary and warned about rather
than allowed to destroy a completed optimisation.

**Passive regions as equal bounds.** Pinning the design variable rather than the
physical density keeps the objective an exact function of the free variables,
which is what makes the finite-difference verification of the gradient
meaningful.

**A hand-written JSON parser.** The build needs nothing but Eigen and a C++17
compiler. The parser accepts `//` and `/* */` comments and a trailing comma,
because an annotated input deck is far easier to maintain, and it reports the
line and column of a syntax error. The `ConfigNode` wrapper records every key it
reads so unknown keys can be reported: a misspelled key that silently takes its
default is one of the easiest ways to publish a wrong number.

**The Python layer never computes physics.** It reads `mesh.json`,
`summary.json` and the CSV tables. Derived values in figures are limited to
ratios and least-squares slopes, and each is labelled as derived. That means a
number in a figure can always be traced to a solver run.

**One dimension-generic core, not two solvers.** Rather than a 3-D copy of
the 2-D code, the dimension is a run-time property of the mesh. What that
bought: every verification study, the optimiser, the writers and the
diagnostics run on the solid path unchanged, and the plane path is protected
by the fixed-size Q4 kernels and the byte-for-byte reproduction check. What it
cost: a handful of `dim`-dependent branches in the constitutive law, the
von Mises formula, the rigid-body-mode table and the face tables.

**MMA returns the iterate it judged.** Convergence is decided on the iterate
whose objective and constraints were just evaluated, and that iterate is the
design returned - not the unevaluated update, which under the objective-stall
criterion can still differ by up to the move limit and need not be feasible.
A stalled objective on an infeasible design is reported as non-convergence,
never as a result.

**Geometry export says what it is.** The STL surface is the boundary of the
thresholded cells, so it inherits the mesh's staircase and every
interpretation choice. The writer checks closure (every directed edge has its
reverse) and manifoldness (no edge used twice each way), compares the enclosed
volume with the cell volume, and records all of it in the summary; a surface
that is closed but non-manifold because cells touch along an edge is reported
as such rather than passed off as a solid.

## Extension points

The interfaces were shaped so the following are additions, not rewrites.

**A new element topology.** Implement `Element` (the kernels plus the local
face table), add an `ElementType` enumerator, and register it in
`make_element()`. That is exactly how `Hex8`, and later `Tri3` and `Tet4`,
were added: the layers above them are written against `dim()`,
`num_nodes()`, `num_faces()` and `num_voigt()` and needed no change beyond
the writers' cell-type tables (VTK, CalculiX, STL faces). `Mesh` stores
connectivity as a flat array with an explicit stride, so one mesh holds one
cell type; mixed meshes (a quad-dominant plane mesh, a hex mesh with prisms)
need that stride replaced by a per-element offset table, which is the one
change outside the new subclasses. The readers refuse such files today and
say how to re-export them.

**Plane strain.** Already implemented and unit-tested end to end: set
`model.stress_state` to `plane_strain`. The constitutive matrix, the von Mises
formula's out-of-plane term and the test coverage are all in place. Plane stress
remains the default and the idealisation the verification studies exercise, so
plane strain is documented as available rather than as validated to the same
depth.

**A new material model.** `FemModel` holds one `IsotropicMaterial` and hands its
constitutive matrix to the element kernels. An orthotropic or
temperature-dependent material replaces that with a small interface returning
`D` per element; nothing above the element layer depends on the material being
isotropic.

**Another mesh format.** `io/MeshReader` reads Gmsh and Abaqus / CalculiX
files into a `Mesh` with named sets and a `MeshReadReport`; a third format
is one more function with the same signature, dispatched on `format` or the
file extension. The checks after parsing (orientation, unused and duplicate
nodes, units, quality) are shared, so a new reader only has to produce
coordinates, cells and sets.

**A different optimiser.** `ComplianceObjective::evaluate` returns the objective,
the volume constraint and both gradients; `optimality_criteria_update` and
`MmaOptimizer::update` are the two update rules, selected by
`optimizer.method`. An augmented-Lagrangian or a trust-region step would be
a third, again without touching the objective.

**A new constraint.** `StressConstraint` is the template, and
`BucklingConstraint` the second instance of it: it takes the model,
the assembler and the filter, evaluates its value and gradient from an
`ObjectiveEvaluation` (reusing the objective's solver for its adjoint solve
through `ComplianceObjective::solve_adjoint`, and its chain rule through the
filter and projection through `ComplianceObjective::chain_to_design`) and
hands one row of `fval` / `dfdx` to MMA. A frequency constraint, a
displacement bound or a second volume budget on a region fits the same
shape.

**A new objective.** The self-adjoint shortcut in `Sensitivity.cpp` is specific
to compliance. A non-self-adjoint objective (a displacement at a point, a
frequency) needs an adjoint solve, which the stress constraint already
exercises: the solver is kept and reused for the adjoint right-hand side,
with its own warm start per adjoint.

**Another linear solver.** `LinearSolver` is the interface: `factorize`,
`solve`, `solve_from` (with an initial guess), `set_layout` (the node
coordinates and DOF map an algebraic multigrid needs), and the statistics
the summary records. A new backend - a supernodal Cholesky, a GPU CG - is a
subclass and an entry in `make_linear_solver()`; the verification studies'
solver-agreement check then covers it.

**A new external code for cross-validation.** `CalculixWriter` shows the
shape: write the same nodes, connectivity, supports and nodal loads in the
target's format, then add a `solve_with_<code>` function and a `compare`
entry in `python/scripts/cross_validate.py`, which already handles the
node-by-node comparison, the tolerances and the summary.
