# Input-deck reference

A run is fully determined by one JSON deck. Every numeric field is SI
(`docs/conventions.md`). Unknown keys are **reported**, and with
`--strict-config` they are an error - a misspelled key that silently takes its
default is one of the easiest ways to publish a wrong number.

Two conveniences beyond strict JSON: `//` and `/* */` comments, and a trailing
comma before `}` or `]`. Everything else follows RFC 8259, and a syntax error
reports its line and column.

## `mesh`

```json
"mesh": { "type": "structured_quad", "nx": 240, "ny": 160,
          "lx": 0.30, "ly": 0.20, "x0": 0.0, "y0": 0.0 }

"mesh": { "type": "structured_hex", "nx": 32, "ny": 16, "nz": 8,
          "lx": 0.24, "ly": 0.12, "lz": 0.06 }

"mesh": { "type": "file", "path": "../meshes/engine_mount_3d.inp", "scale": 0.001 }

"mesh": { "type": "structured_tet", "nx": 20, "ny": 2, "nz": 2,
          "lx": 1.0, "ly": 0.05, "lz": 0.05, "order": 2 }
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `type` | string | `structured_quad` | `structured_quad` (plane, Q4), `structured_tri` (plane, Tri3: each cell split into two triangles), `structured_hex` (solid, Hex8), `structured_tet` (solid, Tet4: each cell split into six Kuhn tetrahedra), or `file` (read from a mesh file) |
| `nx`, `ny` | integer | required for the structured types | elements per direction, `>= 1` |
| `nz` | integer | required for `structured_hex` / `structured_tet` | elements through the third direction |
| `lx`, `ly` | number | required for the structured types | domain extents [m], `> 0` |
| `lz` | number | required for `structured_hex` / `structured_tet` | extent in z [m] |
| `x0`, `y0`, `z0` | number | `0` | lower corner [m] |
| `order` | integer | `1` | `2` makes the tetrahedra quadratic (Tet10): on `structured_tet`, and on a `file` mesh of linear tetrahedra, which is elevated with an edge node at every edge midpoint (straight-sided cells, named sets carried over). A file of 10-node tetrahedra is read as Tet10 without it; `order: 1` on such a file, or `2` on any other cell type, is an error |

The mesh type fixes the dimension of the whole deck: a solid mesh has three
displacement components per node, regions may use `zmin`/`zmax` and
`sphere`, boundary conditions may fix `"z"`, forces and tractions carry three
components, `model.thickness` must be absent (a solid has none) and
`model.stress_state` defaults to `three_dimensional`. Naming `nz`, `lz` or
`z0` on a plane mesh is an error, as is any z component on a plane deck.

**Meshes read from a file** (`"type": "file"`)

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `path` | string | required | the mesh file; a relative path resolves against the deck's directory |
| `format` | string | `auto` | `auto` (from the extension: `.msh` is Gmsh, `.inp` is Abaqus / CalculiX), `gmsh` or `abaqus` |
| `scale` | number | `1` | factor applied to every coordinate: `0.001` for a mesh drawn in millimetres |
| `merge_duplicate_nodes` | bool | `false` | merge coincident nodes instead of only reporting them |
| `duplicate_tolerance` | number [m] | `0` | distance below which two nodes coincide, after scaling; `0` means `1e-9` times the bounding-box diagonal |

Gmsh MSH 2.2 and 4.1 ASCII and Abaqus / CalculiX `.inp` files are read. The
cells of the highest dimension in the file become the mesh: linear triangles
or quadrilaterals give a plane model, linear tetrahedra or hexahedra a solid
one; 10-node tetrahedra (Abaqus `C3D10`, Gmsh type 11, whose last two edge
nodes are swapped into SparLab's order on reading) give a quadratic solid
whose edge nodes may follow curved surfaces. A file that mixes cell types,
or holds any other second-order cell, prisms or pyramids, is refused with a
message saying how to re-export it. Lower
dimensional elements (the boundary curves and facets a mesher writes for its
physical groups) only feed the named sets. Each Gmsh physical group becomes a
node set, and an element set when it holds cells; an Abaqus `*NSET` is a node
set, and an `*ELSET` is an element set when it holds cells and a node set
when it holds boundary elements. Inverted or mirrored cells are re-ordered
and counted, nodes no cell uses are dropped, coincident nodes are reported,
a plane mesh must lie in `z = 0`, and a domain larger than 20 m or smaller
than 0.1 mm draws a warning about units. Boundary conditions, loads and
materials in an `.inp` file are not imported, and the report names every
ignored keyword. What was read and done is recorded under `mesh.file` in
`summary.json`, with the cell-quality statistics under `mesh.quality`.

The resolution of a file mesh comes from the mesher, so `nx` ... `z0` are
errors on a `file` mesh, and so are `--nx`/`--ny`/`--nz` on the command line.
`python/scripts/make_meshes.py` regenerates the meshes the decks use (`make
meshes`, which needs the `gmsh` Python package), the quadratic engine mount
among them.

## `material`

```json
"material": { "name": "Al 7075-T6", "youngs_modulus": 71.7e9,
              "poisson_ratio": 0.33, "density": 2810.0 }
```

| Key | Type | Default | Constraint |
|-----|------|---------|------------|
| `name` | string | `"material"` | carried into result files |
| `youngs_modulus` | number [Pa] | required | `> 0` |
| `poisson_ratio` | number | required | in `(-1, 0.5)` so both idealisations stay positive definite |
| `density` | number [kg/m^3] | `0` | `>= 0`; a positive value is required for modal analysis |

## `model`

```json
"model": { "thickness": 0.008, "stress_state": "plane_stress",
           "integration": { "stiffness_points": 2, "mass_points": 3,
                            "edge_points": 2 } }
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `thickness` | number [m] | `1.0` | out-of-plane thickness, `> 0`; plane meshes only - a solid mesh rejects the key |
| `stress_state` | string | `plane_stress` (`three_dimensional` on a solid mesh) | `plane_stress`, `plane_strain` or `three_dimensional`; the plane idealisations need a plane mesh (Q4 or Tri3) and `three_dimensional` a solid one (Hex8 or Tet4) |
| `integration.stiffness_points` | integer | `2` | Gauss points per direction for `K_e`, 1-4 (2x2 for the Q4, 2x2x2 for the Hex8); the linear simplices have a constant strain and integrate exactly with one point whatever is set here |
| `integration.mass_points` | integer | `3` | Gauss points per direction for `M_e`, 1-4; the simplices use the exact closed-form consistent mass instead |
| `integration.face_points` | integer | `2` | Gauss points per direction on a loaded edge or face, 1-4; `edge_points` is accepted as a synonym |

## Regions

Boundary conditions, loads and passive regions all take a `region` object. A
region is the union of one or more primitives, optionally complemented.

```json
"region": { "name": "bolt_attachments", "invert": false, "tolerance": 0.0,
            "any_of": [
              { "circle": { "center": [0.030, 0.045], "radius": 0.0105 } },
              { "circle": { "center": [0.030, 0.155], "radius": 0.0105 } }
            ] }
```

A single primitive may also be written directly in the `region` object, without
`any_of`.

| Primitive | Form | Selects |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `all` | `"all": true` | everything |
| `box` | `{ "xmin":, "xmax":, "ymin":, "ymax":, "zmin":, "zmax": }`, any subset | points inside the axis-aligned box; omitted sides are unbounded; `zmin`/`zmax` on a solid mesh only |
| `circle` | `{ "center": [x, y(, z)], "radius": r, "axis": "z" }` | the closed disc; on a solid mesh, the infinite cylinder of that radius about the line through `center` along `axis` (`x`, `y` or `z`, default `z`) |
| `annulus` | `{ "center": [...], "inner_radius": r0, "radius": r1, "axis": "z" }` | the closed ring, `r0 < r1`; a tube on a solid mesh |
| `sphere` | `{ "center": [x, y, z], "radius": r }` | the closed ball (solid meshes only) |
| `node_ids` | `[...]` | explicit nodes (node regions only) |
| `element_ids` | `[...]` | explicit elements (element regions only) |
| `nearest_node` | `[x, y(, z)]` | the single node closest to the point (node regions only) |
| `group` | `"name"` | a named set of a mesh read from a file: its node set in a node region, its element set in an element region |

A `center` or `nearest_node` point carries as many components as the mesh has
dimensions. A `group` that the mesh does not have is an error listing the
sets it does have; so is a `group` on a structured mesh, which has none.

| Region key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|------------|------|---------|---------|
| `name` | string | auto | used in diagnostics |
| `invert` | bool | `false` | select the complement of the union |
| `tolerance` | number [m] | `0` | absolute geometric tolerance; `0` means `1e-9` times the mesh diagonal |

A degenerate box such as `{"xmax": 0.0}` reliably captures the line of nodes at
`x = 0` because of that relative tolerance. Element regions are tested at the
element centroid. Naming two primitives in one region object without `any_of` is
an error, as is a region that selects nothing.

## `boundary_conditions`

```json
"boundary_conditions": [
  { "name": "clamped_root", "fix": ["x", "y"], "value": [0.0, 0.0],
    "region": { "box": { "xmax": 0.0 } } }
]
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `name` | string | auto | diagnostics |
| `fix` | array of `"x"` / `"y"` (/ `"z"` on a solid mesh) | required, non-empty | which components to prescribe |
| `value` | `[u_x, u_y(, u_z)]` [m] | zeros | prescribed displacement |
| `region` | object | required | node region |

Non-zero values are handled by static condensation, not by modifying the load
vector, so the reactions stay exact.

## `load_cases`

```json
"load_cases": [
  { "name": "down_limit", "weight": 1.0,
    "point_loads": [
      { "name": "lug", "force": [0.0, -9000.0], "distribution": "total",
        "region": { "annulus": { "center": [0.270, 0.100],
                                 "inner_radius": 0.0075, "radius": 0.0105 } } }
    ],
    "tractions": [
      { "name": "upper_skin", "traction": [0.0, -1.2e5],
        "region": { "box": { "ymin": 0.10 } } }
    ]
  }
]
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `name` | string | auto | used in file names and reports |
| `weight` | number | `1.0` | weight in the multi-load objective, `>= 0`; weights are normalised to sum to 1 |
| `point_loads` | array | `[]` | concentrated nodal forces |
| `tractions` | array | `[]` | distributed edge loads |
| `prescribed_displacement_only` | bool | `false` | declares a case with no applied force, driven by the prescribed displacements (the patch test, enforced-deflection studies) |

**Point load**

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `force` | `[F_x, F_y(, F_z)]` [N] | required | see `distribution` |
| `distribution` | `"total"` / `"per_node"` | `"total"` | `total` divides the resultant among the selected nodes, so the total force is mesh independent; `per_node` applies `force` to each node |
| `region` | object | required | node region |

**Traction**

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `traction` | `[t_x, t_y(, t_z)]` [Pa] | required | stress vector in **global** components, not a normal pressure |
| `region` | object | required | node region; a boundary edge (face, on a solid mesh) is loaded when *all* its nodes lie inside |

Tractions are integrated to consistent nodal forces, so the resultant is exactly
`traction * (loaded length) * thickness` on a plane mesh and
`traction * (loaded area)` on a solid one, at any mesh resolution. A traction
region matching no boundary edge or face is an error.

A load case with neither `point_loads` nor `tractions` is an error unless
`prescribed_displacement_only` is set.

## `solver`

```json
"solver": {
  "linear": { "type": "auto", "residual_tolerance": 1e-8,
              "iterative_tolerance": 1e-12, "max_iterations": 0,
              "pivot_tolerance": 1e-14, "warm_start": true,
              "auto_direct_limit": { "plane": 50000, "solid": 10000 },
              "amg": { "smoother": "chebyshev", "smoother_degree": 3,
                       "strength_threshold": 0.02, "coarse_size": 1500 } },
  "equilibrium_tolerance": 1e-6,
  "check_model": true
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `linear.type` | string | `auto` | `auto`, `simplicial_ldlt`, `amg_cg` (also `amg`, `multigrid`), `conjugate_gradient`, `simplicial_llt`, `sparse_lu`, `dense_lu` |
| `linear.residual_tolerance` | number | `1e-8` | scaled residual `||K u - f|| / ||f||` accepted after each solve, whatever the solver |
| `linear.iterative_tolerance` | number | `1e-12` | relative residual the CG solvers iterate to |
| `linear.max_iterations` | integer | `0` | CG iteration cap; `0` means `2n` for Jacobi CG and 1000 for multigrid CG |
| `linear.pivot_tolerance` | number | `1e-14` | smallest accepted `min/max` LDL^T pivot ratio |
| `linear.warm_start` | bool | `true` | start each iterative solve from the previous solution of the same load case (or adjoint); an optimisation loop then needs a fraction of the iterations |
| `linear.auto_direct_limit.plane` | integer | `50000` | `auto` factorises a plane system with at most this many free unknowns and uses multigrid CG above it |
| `linear.auto_direct_limit.solid` | integer | `10000` | the same limit for a solid system, where the Cholesky fill grows much faster |
| `equilibrium_tolerance` | number | `1e-6` | relative force-balance error before `SolverError` |
| `check_model` | bool | `true` | run the rigid-body and floating-region diagnostics before assembling |

The solvers: `simplicial_ldlt` is Eigen's sparse LDL^T with an AMD ordering,
the reference; `amg_cg` is conjugate gradients preconditioned by SparLab's
smoothed-aggregation algebraic multigrid (`docs/formulation.md` gives the
construction); `conjugate_gradient` is Eigen's Jacobi-preconditioned CG, kept
as the baseline that shows what the multigrid buys; `simplicial_llt`,
`sparse_lu` and `dense_lu` exist for the solver-agreement verification. The
summary records which solver ran (`auto:AMG-CG(chebyshev)`, for instance),
its settings and, for the iterative ones, the iteration counts.

**`linear.amg`** - the multigrid preconditioner. The defaults are the
measured ones; change them to study the solver, not to make a run work.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `strength_threshold` | number | `0.02` | node pairs whose coupling block is weaker than this (relative, Frobenius) are not aggregated together |
| `max_levels` | integer | `12` | hierarchy depth cap |
| `coarse_size` | integer | `1500` | unknowns at or below which a level is solved directly (dense LDL^T) |
| `smoother` | string | `chebyshev` | `chebyshev` or `gauss_seidel` (symmetric) |
| `smoother_degree` | integer | `3` | Chebyshev degree, or Gauss-Seidel sweeps |
| `chebyshev_ratio` | number | `30` | the smoother targets eigenvalues in `[lambda_max / ratio, lambda_max]` |
| `prolongator_damping` | number | `4/3` | Jacobi damping of the tentative prolongator, divided by `lambda_max(D^-1 A)` |
| `lanczos_steps` | integer | `12` | Lanczos steps of the `lambda_max` estimate |
| `reuse_aggregates` | bool | `true` | keep the aggregation (and the sparsity of every product) across refactorisations of a matrix with the same pattern, as in an optimisation loop |
| `coarse_pivot_tolerance` | number | `1e-13` | a coarsest-level pivot below this, relative to the largest, is reported as an under-constrained model |

## `modal`

```json
"modal": { "enabled": true, "num_modes": 6, "mass_type": "consistent",
           "tolerance": 1e-10, "residual_tolerance": 1e-6,

|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | run free-vibration analysis |
| `num_modes` | integer | `6` | lowest modes requested, `>= 1` |
| `mass_type` | string | `consistent` | or `lumped` (row-sum) |
| `tolerance` | number | `1e-10` | relative eigenvalue change for convergence |
| `residual_tolerance` | number | `1e-6` | eigenpair residual, also part of the stopping rule |
| `max_iterations` | integer | `200` | subspace-iteration cap |
| `shift_factor` | number | `0` | shift as a multiple of `min_i K_ii/M_ii`; `0` disables |
| `rigid_body_ratio` | number | `1e-10` | below this times the stiffness/mass scale, a mode is flagged as rigid-body |
| `seed` | integer | `20240917` | seed for the filler part of the starting basis |
| `analyse_optimised_topology` | bool | `true` | also compute *mode shapes* of the thresholded solid interpretation |
| `compare_mass_matched_baseline` | bool | `true` | topology runs also analyse an equal-mass uniform plate |

## `buckling`

```json
"buckling": { "enabled": true, "num_modes": 4, "tolerance": 1e-8,
              "residual_tolerance": 1e-6, "max_iterations": 400,
              "seed": 20240917, "load_cases": ["axial"],
              "analyse_optimised_topology": true }
```

A linear (bifurcation) buckling analysis of each load case's linear static
state, `(K + lambda K_G(u)) phi = 0` (`docs/formulation.md`, section 7b).
`sparlab_solve` runs it on the analysed model; `sparlab_topopt` runs it
after the optimisation on the full solid domain and on the exported part.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | run the buckling analysis |
| `num_modes` | integer | `4` | lowest positive load factors requested, `>= 1` |
| `tolerance` | number | `1e-8` | relative change of the requested load factors for convergence |

| `max_iterations` | integer | `400` | subspace-iteration cap |
| `seed` | integer | `20240917` | seed of the random part of the starting subspace |
| `load_cases` | array of strings | all | load cases to analyse, by name |
| `analyse_optimised_topology` | bool | `true` | in a topology run, also analyse the exported part |

A load factor above 1 is a safety factor on the load case; a load case that
only stretches the structure has no positive load factor and is reported
as such. The results are `buckling_<solid|topology>.csv` with every mode's
load factor, residual and energy share in solid material, and, with
`output.vtk` and `output.mode_shapes`, one VTK file per mode.

## `topology`

```json

      "region": { "circle": { "center": [0.030, 0.045], "radius": 0.010 } } }
  ]
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | `sparlab_topopt` requires `true` |
| `volume_fraction` | number | `0.4` | target `nu`, in `(0, 1]`; measured on the physical density over the **whole** domain, passive regions included |
| `initial_density` | number | `-1` | starting value for free variables; negative means "use `volume_fraction`". The value used is recorded as `optimization_setup.initial_density`. Start below the target when passive solid regions take a large share of the budget, or the first update may not reach it (`engine_mount_3d`) |

**`simp`**

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `penalty` | number | `3.0` | `p >= 1` |
| `emin_ratio` | number | `1e-9` | `E_min/E_0`, in `(0, 1)` |

| `type` | string | `density` | `density`, `sensitivity` or `none` |
| `radius` | number [m] | - | radius in metres; takes precedence when `> 0` |
| `radius_elements` | number | `1.5` | radius as a multiple of the mean element size |

Specify the radius in **metres** when comparing meshes: that holds the minimum
length scale fixed, which is what makes the optimum mesh convergent.

**`optimizer`**

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `max_iterations` | integer | `200` | iteration cap |
| `change_tolerance` | number | `1e-2` | stop when `max |dx|` falls below this |
| `objective_tolerance` | number | `0` | stop when the relative spread `(max - min) / |c_k|` of the last `objective_window + 1` compliances falls below this; `0` disables. For a monotone history that is the change over the window, and an oscillating design cannot satisfy it mid-cycle |

| `constraint_tolerance` | number | `1e-4` | MMA: largest constraint value `g_i <= tol` for an iterate to count as feasible; convergence requires feasibility |
| `mma.move_limit` | number | `move_limit` | MMA per-iteration bound on the design change |
| `mma.asymptote_init` | number | `0.5` | initial asymptote distance as a fraction of the variable range |
| `mma.asymptote_increase` | number | `1.2` | asymptote widening when a variable keeps moving the same way |
| `mma.asymptote_decrease` | number | `0.7` | asymptote tightening when it oscillates |
| `mma.constraint_penalty` | number | `1000` | Svanberg's `c_i`: the price of the artificial variables that relax a constraint |
| `mma.subproblem_tolerance` | number | `1e-7` | final barrier parameter of the interior-point subproblem solver; each barrier level is converged when the KKT residual falls below 0.9 times it |
| `mma.max_newton_iterations` | integer | `500` | Newton iterations allowed per barrier level, `>= 10`; running out is a `ConvergenceError` naming the residual block that stalled |

**`stress`** - an aggregated von Mises stress constraint, one per load case.
Requires `method: "mma"` and the density filter (the sensitivity filter has no
gradient the adjoint could use).

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | add the constraint |
| `limit` | number [Pa] | required | allowable von Mises stress |
| `p_norm` | number | `8` | exponent `P` of the p-norm aggregate; larger tracks the maximum more closely at the price of a rougher constraint |
| `relaxation` | number | `0.5` | qp-relaxation exponent `q`: the relaxed stress is `rho^q sigma_vm(solid)`, so a void element cannot violate the limit |
| `scaling_blend` | number | `0.5` | weight `alpha` in the adaptive scale `c_k = alpha s_max/g_PN + (1 - alpha) c_{k-1}` that makes the aggregate track the true maximum |
| `feasibility_tolerance` | number | `1e-3` | relative margin the summary uses when it reports whether the *relaxed* maximum meets the limit |

`docs/topology_optimization.md` gives the formulation and says what the
constraint does and does not guarantee.

```json
"topology": {
  "projection": { "enabled": true, "eta": 0.5, "beta_start": 1, "beta_max": 32,
                  "beta_factor": 2, "beta_interval": 40,
                  "advance_on_convergence": true }
}
```

**`projection`** - the smoothed Heaviside projection of the filtered density,
with continuation of its sharpness `beta`. The projected density is the
physical one: SIMP, the volume constraint, the stress constraint and the
grey level all act on it. Needs the density filter (or no filter); with the
sensitivity filter it is a `ConfigError`.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | project the filtered density |
| `eta` | number | `0.5` | threshold of the step, in `(0, 1)` |
| `beta_start` | number | `1` | first sharpness, `> 0` |
| `beta_max` | number | `32` | final sharpness, `>= beta_start` |
| `beta_factor` | number | `2` | multiplier per continuation stage, `> 1` |
| `beta_interval` | integer | `50` | most iterations spent at one `beta` |
| `advance_on_convergence` | bool | `true` | move to the next `beta` as soon as the design change at the current one falls below `change_tolerance` |
| `robust` | bool | `false` | robust formulation: objective and constraints on the eroded design (`eta + robust_delta`), volume on the dilated one (`eta - robust_delta`), the blueprint (`eta`) reported and exported (`docs/topology_optimization.md`, section 3c) |
| `robust_delta` | number | `0.1` | `delta` of the eroded and dilated thresholds; `eta +- delta` must lie in `(0, 1)` |
| `robust_volume_interval` | integer | `1` | iterations between rescalings of the dilated volume target; use about 20 with OC |
| `erosion_check` | bool | `false` | without `robust`: evaluate the final design at `eta +- robust_delta` once, to report how much it loses if the part comes out thinner or thicker |

Convergence is only declared at `beta_max`, and the objective-stall history
restarts at every `beta` step because the objective changes with it. A run
that stops at the iteration cap before reaching `beta_max` says so in a
warning.

```json
"topology": {
  "optimizer": { "method": "mma", "move_limit": 0.05, "mma": { "max_newton_iterations": 3000 } },
  "buckling_constraint": { "enabled": true, "min_load_factor": 6.0, "num_modes": 6,
                           "ks_parameter": 40.0, "solid_threshold": 0.5,
                           "load_cases": ["axial"] }
}
```

**`buckling_constraint`** - the lowest positive buckling load factors of the
SIMP design at or above a required multiple of each constrained load case,
aggregated by a KS function (`docs/topology_optimization.md`, section 5d).
Requires `method: "mma"` and the density filter (or none).

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | add the constraint |
| `min_load_factor` | number | `1` | required load factor `lambda_req`, `> 0` |
| `num_modes` | integer | `6` | load factors aggregated per load case, in `[1, 50]` |
| `ks_parameter` | number | `40` | KS parameter `P`, in `[1, 500]`; the aggregate overestimates the largest ratio by at most `ln(num_modes)/P` |
| `solid_threshold` | number | `0.5` | density at which an element counts as solid in the pseudo-mode diagnostic |
| `load_cases` | array of strings | all | load cases to constrain, by name |
| `tolerance`, `residual_tolerance`, `max_iterations`, `seed` | | as `buckling` | settings of the eigensolve |

The load factors it holds are the SIMP model's; the `buckling` section
checks the exported part, which is the number to judge.

```json
"topology": {
  "overhang": { "filter": true, "build_direction": "+y",
                "smax_exponent": 40, "smax_reference": 0.5, "smin_epsilon": 1e-4 },
  "length_scale_check": { "enabled": true, "max_radius_elements": 8, "tolerance": 0.02 }
}
```

**`overhang`** - the additive-manufacturing overhang rule
(`docs/topology_optimization.md`, section 3d). Its presence switches on the
overhang check of the final design; `filter` also applies the filter during
the optimisation. Needs a `structured_quad` or `structured_hex` mesh and,
with the filter, the density filter (or none).

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `build_direction` | string | required | `+x`, `-x`, `+y`, `-y` (and `+z`, `-z` in 3-D): the axis the part grows along, from the plate at the low end (`+`) or the high end (`-`) |
| `filter` | bool | `false` | apply the overhang filter between the density filter and the projection |
| `smax_exponent` | number | `40` | `P` of the smooth maximum, in `[2, 200]`, and large enough that `Q = P + ln(n)/ln(xi_0)` stays positive for the supports present |
| `smax_reference` | number | `0.5` | `xi_0`, the value at which the smooth maximum of equal supports is exact, in `(0, 1)` |
| `smin_epsilon` | number | `1e-4` | `epsilon` of the smooth minimum, in `(0, 0.1)` |

**`length_scale_check`** - the morphological measurement of the smallest
member and gap of the final thresholded design. On by default in a robust
run; the section's presence switches it on otherwise.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | on with `robust` or when the section is present | run the check |
| `max_radius_elements` | number | `6` | largest probe radius, in cells (probes step by half a cell), `>= 0.5` |
| `tolerance` | number | `0.02` | share of the solid (void) volume a probe may change and still pass, in `[0, 0.5)`; opening rounds convex corners, so zero is too strict |

**`passive_regions`** - an array of

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `name` | string | auto | diagnostics |
| `type` | string | `solid` | `solid` (`x = 1`) or `void` (`x = density`) |
| `density` | number | `0` | density imposed on a void region, in `[0, 1)` |
| `region` | object | required | element region |

## `output`

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `csv` | bool | `true` | per-node and per-element CSV tables |
| `vtk` | bool | `true` | legacy VTK field files for ParaView |
| `density_history` | bool | `true` | density snapshots for the animation |
| `mode_shapes` | bool | `true` | mode-shape CSV and per-mode VTK |

`summary.json` and `mesh.json` are always written: a result directory should be
self-describing.

## Command-line overrides

`sparlab_topopt` accepts overrides so a parametric study never has to edit or
duplicate a deck. Each corresponds to one deck field:

```
--volume-fraction        topology.volume_fraction
--penalty                topology.simp.penalty
--filter-radius          topology.filter.radius            (metres)
--filter-radius-elements topology.filter.radius_elements   (cells)
--filter-type            topology.filter.type
--max-iterations         topology.optimizer.max_iterations
--method oc|mma          topology.optimizer.method
--stress-limit <Pa>      topology.stress.limit, and enables the constraint and MMA
--no-stress              topology.stress.enabled = false
--nx --ny (--nz)         mesh.nx, mesh.ny (mesh.nz, solid meshes only; an error on a file mesh)
--youngs-modulus         material.youngs_modulus
--load-weights w1,w2,... one weight per load case, in deck order
--modes N                modal.enabled = true, modal.num_modes = N
--solver TYPE            solver.linear.type
--projection             topology.projection.enabled = true (deck or default schedule)
--no-projection          topology.projection.enabled = false
--beta-max B             topology.projection.beta_max, and enables the projection
--buckling N             buckling.enabled = true, buckling.num_modes = N
--min-load-factor L      topology.buckling_constraint.min_load_factor, and enables the constraint and MMA
--no-buckling-constraint topology.buckling_constraint.enabled = false
--robust / --no-robust   topology.projection.robust (--robust also enables the projection)
--overhang DIR           topology.overhang.build_direction = DIR, filter = true
--no-overhang-filter     topology.overhang.filter = false (the check stays)
--tag NAME               appended to the case name in summary.json
```

`sparlab_solve` takes `--solver`, `--modes` and `--buckling` too. With
`--export-calculix` it additionally writes one CalculiX input deck per load
case (`calculix_<case>.inp`: CPS4 / CPE4, CPS3 / CPE3, C3D8, C3D4 or C3D10
elements, the same nodes, supports and nodal loads, every field within
CalculiX's 20 characters) into the output directory, which is what
`scripts/run_cross_validation.sh` feeds to `ccx`, as a static step and, for a
run with buckling, as a `*BUCKLE` step.

Run any app with `--help` for its full flag list.
