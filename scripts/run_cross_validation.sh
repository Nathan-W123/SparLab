# Solves the reference analysis decks - the 2-D cantilever and the 3-D block
# on Q4 / Hex8 and on Tri3 / Tet4 elements, the two Gmsh parts (the lug
# bracket at its real Poisson ratio and at nu = 0, the engine mount on Tet4
# and on curved Tet10 cells), and an axially loaded column on Hex8, Tet4 and
# Tet10 with its linear buckling check - and the decks of the volume,
# pressure and thermal loads (a block under self-weight, pressure, rotation
# and a body force on Hex8 and Tet10; a two-material plate with conducted,
# uniform and regional temperatures on Hex8, Tet10 and plane-strain Q4; the
# curved Tet10 engine mount under a bore pressure, self-weight, rotation and
# conduction) - and the geometrically non-linear decks (the elastica on
# Tet10, a soft Hex8 block under a follower pressure and a rotation, a
# plane-strain Q4 strip under a dead load and a follower pressure, a
# neo-Hookean Tet10 block with a driven tip) and the elastoplastic decks (a
# cantilever loaded past yield and unloaded on Hex8, a plane-strain strip on
# Q4, a punch on Tet10, cycles with combined hardening, a plate heated past
# yield, a large-deflection cantilever, a clamped beam driven into membrane
# action and back on Hex8 and in plane strain and plane stress on Q4) - and the
# dynamics decks (linear transients on Hex8 with HHT-alpha and Rayleigh
# damping, on Tet10 under a harmonic force and on a plane-strain Q4 strip
# shaken at its root with lumped mass; harmonic responses of a Q4 plate and of
# a Hex8 block on a shaken base; an elastoplastic and a large-deflection
# transient on Hex8) - and the contact decks (a block held by its contact
# alone on another with non-matching Hex8 meshes, a punch pressing and
# dragging a block along another with friction, a rising rigid plane under
# a Tet4 block, a rigid cylinder pressed and dragged along a plane-strain Q4
# block with friction, a rigid sphere indenting a Hex8 block with friction,
# a cylinder cap on a Q4 block) - and the shell decks (a simply supported
# plate, the Scordelis-Lo roof, the pinched hemisphere, a box beam read from
# an S4R file) - with sparlab_solve (exporting CalculiX decks), then
# compares the nodal displacements node by node, the conducted
# temperatures, the buckling load factors mode by mode, the final non-linear
# states and the transient histories and harmonic responses, with CalculiX
# (ccx: static, *BUCKLE, *HEAT TRANSFER, *STEP, NLGEOM, *PLASTIC and
# *DYNAMIC, each load in CalculiX's own form) and scikit-fem (with SparLab's
# load vector, with the loads integrated by scikit-fem, an independent total
# Lagrangian solve, an independent J2 solve, small strain or finite, an
# independent HHT-alpha integration, a direct complex harmonic solve and an
# independent contact solve, an independent MITC4 in NumPy), and for the
# solid contact decks CalculiX's linear dual mortar contact (LINMORTAR); the
# shells' CalculiX S4 results are recorded for information.
# Exits non-zero if any comparison exceeds its documented tolerance.
